## Exercise: Best Teacher Ever

Spend a minute or two thinking about the teacher who taught you the most over your whole life. Write down one specific positive memory you have of that person. What did they say and do? How did they make you feel? What did you learn? Why was it a good experience?

::: instructor
Give students five minutes to think and write, then spend ten minutes going over answers. Make a note of what experiences were shared vs which ones were unique.

## An Incomplete List

It's likely that your favorite teacher:

- was well-prepared to teach their subject;
- shared a clear pathway for what and how they wanted you to learn;
- taught a subject that was interesting or useful for you;
- made you feel actively engaged in the learning process;
- made you feel challenged but not overwhelmed;
- gave you space to ask questions or challenge them;
- made you feel safe;
- didn't shame you for lack of knowledge;
- was responsive to your needs;
- wasn't condescending;
- assumed that you had potential;
- acknowledged your growth;
- provided kind and useful feedback.


Our goal over the next two weeks is to equip you with foundational knowledge and practice about learning and teaching. We hope that these first steps will set you up well to grow as an instructor in the years to come.

## It's Okay If You Don't Like Teaching

There are many people who love teaching and want to be in the classroom, but who have not yet learned the skills to teach effectively. On the flip side, there are people who do not have a particular passion for teaching, but who are still excellent instructors. These people have learned the techniques and practices of effective instruction. Even if you never love teaching, you can employ the skills you're about to learn to provide the best possible experience for both you and your students.
