<p>There are many people who love teaching and want to be in the
classroom, but who have not yet learned the skills to teach effectively.
On the flip side, there are people who do not have a particular passion
for teaching, but who are still excellent instructors. These people have
learned the techniques and practices of effective instruction. Even if
you never love teaching, you can employ the skills you’re about to learn
to provide the best possible experience for both you and your
students.</p>

art.”</p>

<p>The exercise above showed people giving three different types of
feedback. The sister gave harsh negative feedback, claiming that the
child was categorically bad at art. The mother gave gushing positive
feedback, claiming that the child was categorically good at art. The
aunt gave some positive feedback, while also gently suggesting ways that
the child might improve in the future.</p>
<p>The child’s mother and sister were both demonstrating what
psychologist Carol Dweck calls a <strong>fixed mindset</strong>. This is
the belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made. The
child’s aunt, on the other hand, was demonstrating the belief that
ability can be acquired through effort– a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>. Especially when learning something that feels complex
or intimidating, a fixed mindset can interfere with motivation and
growth in a number of ways, as laid out in this diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/perquiro_growth.png" alt="Fixed vs Growth Mindsets." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.</div>

learners, and the best way to do so is to embody a growth mindset
yourself. Let’s go through a few common challenges instructors encounter
and consider how we might bring a growth mindset to them.</p>

<p>How might someone with a fixed mindset respond to each of these
common challenges? What about someone with a growth mindset?</p>
<ul>
<li>A learner asks you a question you don’t know the answer to.</li>
<li>You’re doing a live coding demonstration, and your code throws an
error when you didn’t expect it to.</li>
<li>You’re helping someone write a few lines of code, but they’re a slow
typer. It would be faster if you took their computer and did it yourself
as they watched.</li>
<li>A student is feeling frustrated and tells you, “I’m just no good at
coding!”.</li>

<p>We’ll go into more detail about how to cultivate a growth mindset in
the classroom next week. But for now, let’s spend a little time
cultivating a growth mindset in ourselves by practicing giving and
receiving feedback.</p>
</section><section id="ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"><h2 class="section-heading">ASK for Feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are many metaphors and acronyms designed to help people give
good feedback. One of our favorites is called the ASK framework. It
recommends that any feedback you provide to someone should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actionable</strong>: If you critique someone on something
they have no power to change, your feedback has limited power to help
them grow. Furthermore, they may wind up feeling demotivated, or even
defensive. Stick to the possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Specific</strong>: “Make it better” is actionable feedback,
but it doesn’t really help guide someone towards a better product. It’s
much more helpful to specify where, how, and why you’re recommending
changes. For example, “I think the narrative is clearer if you switch
these two paragraphs”, or “on line 76, you’re taking the median value of
your data, but it would be more appropriate to take the mean”.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kind</strong>: Even if you strongly dislike the thing you’re
critiquing, it’s likely that someone spent a lot of time and effort on
it. If you have ever had someone absolutely rip apart something
meaningful to you, you know how crushing it can be. Think about the
words you use. If you’re speaking to someone directly, think about your
body language and tone. Remember what it felt like the last time someone
was gentle with you. There are two sub-strategies that work well to
support kind feedback:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Good news first</em>: Start by talking about the aspects of the
work you enjoyed, and acknowledging the effort that went into it. This
helps the feedback receiver to feel secure and open to receiving more
critical comments.</li>
<li>
<em>“I” statements</em>: When you are, for example, reviewing a
paper, sometimes it’s tempting to say “this section is confusing.” But
you don’t actually know that for sure! It was confusing to you, but
clearly it made sense to the person who wrote it, and maybe it would
also make sense to someone else. When you give feedback, instead
consider saying “I was confused by this section because…” and continue
with actionable, specific feedback. This is both a more true reflection
of your critique, and a kinder way of providing comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></section><section id="ask-to-ask"><h2 class="section-heading">Ask to ASK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-to-ask"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There’s another reason we love the acronym ASK for feedback: it
reminds us that the giving of feedback should always be preceded by a
<em>question</em>. Usually, someone asks you for feedback, but
occasionally it’s also appropriate for you to ask someone if they would
like your opinion. Ideally, requests to receive or give feedback should
also follow the ASK protocol. For example, say “Hey, I made a figure for
a paper but I’m not sure if it’s easy to understand, could you tell me
what story this plot tells you?” instead of “What do you think of this
plot?” This will help guide the feedback-giver toward the actual type of
advice you’re hoping to receive.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even when feedback is actively solicited and given in the kindest
possible way, it can feel terrible to receive. Many of us, especially
those of us who grew up with a fixed mindset, often want our first try
to be perfect. When someone gives us tips on how to improve, we can feel
humiliated, defensive, and demotivated, because we have not lived up to
the standard we set for ourselves.</p>
<p>The process of sitting with and moving past the discomfort that comes
with feedback is a crucial component of developing a growth mindset.
Everyone develops their own strategy to work through this. Here’s an
example of how one of your instructors does it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For a few minutes, let myself feel whatever I need to. That person
just didn’t <em>understand</em> me! What do <em>they</em> know anyway?
Oh no, am I <em>terrible at this</em>? What if I’m <em>never</em>
successful?</li>
<li>Start to “reality test” those high-emotion thoughts. Do I really
think the person who gave me feedback didn’t know what they were talking
about? Do I really think that I’m bad at this, or am I proud of the
effort I put in? Don’t I want to learn how to do better? Isn’t the only
way to be successful to keep trying?</li>
<li>When I’m ready, sit back down with the feedback and really think
through it. What good points did this person make? What feedback can I
respectfully decline? It’s usually at this point that I actually start
getting excited about incorporating the feedback, because I can see how
it will make my work stronger.</li>
<li>Continue incorporating and refining the feedback. At this point I’m
usually really happy and grateful that I asked for help. If I can, I’ll
thank the person who gave me feedback. I might feel kind of silly for
how I responded before, but I know that it’s a human response that will
happen again. I trust myself to handle it appropriately next time it
happens.</li>

<p>We will now get started with a discussion of how learning works. We
will begin with some key concepts from educational research and identify
how these principles are put into practice in Carpentries workshops.</p>
<section id="the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"><h2 class="section-heading">The Carpentries Pedagogical Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
Following them, in this course we take an applied approach, avoiding the
theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and
providing hands-on practice, we develop learners’ confidence and lay the
foundation for future learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>a workshop is an interactive event</strong> –
for learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout
the course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
workshop is not simply a source of information; it is the starting point
for development of a new skill. To understand what this means, we will
start by exploring what research tells us about skill acquisition and
development of a “mental model.”</p>
</section><section id="the-acquisition-of-skill"><h2 class="section-heading">The Acquisition of Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-acquisition-of-skill"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a data visualization workshop
might never have made a plot using code, and may have no understanding
of how to load data into an R or Python workspace, much less visualize
it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a data visualization
workshop might have used <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>matplotlib</code>
before and knows how to generate common plots (line, scatter, bar) using
default color schemes, but may not know how to customize appearance,
labeling, color, or faceting.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that
are out of the ordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a data visualization workshop may have
extensive experience creating high-quality plots for publication and
presentation, as well as an understanding of visualization theory. When
presented with complex data to visualize, they may immediately come up
with creative ideas to tell an effective story.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in a
few episodes. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is often our primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

</h3>
<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarized by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential
to generate misconceptions that may interfere with learning.</p>

<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to
say:</p>
<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –
inspiring a comparison with something concrete, hands on, practical, and
useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organization: to support
computational skill development among working practitioners who need the
right tools and practices to be effective day to day.</p>

<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualize a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organizers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organize these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>
<p>The concept map below illustrates a simple mental model that a young
child might develop after putting the ball in the water.</p>

<p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>

</h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanzania.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that humid air causes malaria, or that seasons are
related to the shape of the earth’s orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in workshops. While teaching, we want to expose learners’
broken models so that we can help them begin to deconstruct them and
build better ones in their place.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not immediately used to guide further progress and are
hence called <strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Any instructional tool that generates feedback that is used to inform
the rest of the course can be described as “formative assessment.” what
types of formative assessments have you seen, either in your previous

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?

a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides
valuable insight.</p>

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>
</section><section id="the-importance-of-going-slowly"><h2 class="section-heading">The Importance of Going Slowly<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-going-slowly"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Learners coming to data science workshops may be novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they

</div>
<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the <a href="TODO">data visualization training Gloria Shirima ran in
Kigali</a>, we only covered two types of plot (line and scatter) for
three hours of teaching. An hour and a half per command may seem
glacially slow, but that course’s real purpose was to teach learners
about the fundamental theory of plot creation, especially the concepts
of layers and aesthetic mappings. From that foundation, constructing
more involved and complex plots will be much easier.</p>
<p>That mental model of ggplot also includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating informative variable names (so you can differentiate
between a multiple of plots in one script).</li>
<li>Writing code in scripts rather than the console (to ensure you don’t
lose it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning consists of more than “just” adding information to mental
models; creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as
important. Telling people that they should name things nicely and
consistently, and that they should focus on the location and protection
of the code they write, both set the stage for discussing of code
hygiene and replicability. We’re laying foundations of the practices we
want to promote even when not discussing them directly.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training, we will use a modified version of Nicholl’s five phase
paradigm for curriculum design<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nicholls’ paradigm describes a process,
commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish
to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their
learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the
lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum
design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated
outcomes. The Carpentries developed the modified version of Nicholls’
system that we will use in this workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching</li>
<li>Evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/cldt-design-process.svg" style="width:67.0%" alt="A flow diagram presenting the process of lesson design and development used in this training." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>We assess learners two different ways in this framework. The first,
in Step 2, refers to the ways we will assess learner progress <em>while
the teaching is still going on</em>, to give instructors opportunities
to evaluate the teaching and lesson content before the end of the
workshop. This type of mid-course assessment is called a
<em>formative</em> assessment.</p>
<p>The second, in Step 4, refers to a <em>summative</em> assessment: an
assessment that takes place at the end of a lesson to tell whether the
desired learning has taken place. Final exams are the most common
examples of summative assessments, but in our case the exit survey that
you will complete will form as a summative assessment. This final survey
will help us iterate and refine the content as a whole for future
trainings.</p>
<p>Note the cyclical nature of the lesson design process: you will
complete one iteration through this cycle during this training. Note
also that <em>teaching the content</em> is an essential intermediate
step in the process: the importance of feedback gathered while teaching
the lesson will be a common refrain throughout this training.</p>

<p>Over these two weeks, we will be focusing on helping you develop a
single short lesson to teach the fundamentals of curriculum design.
However, these same skills can be used to build out a much more
extensive curriculum (like the one you’re learning now). And because so
many of the skills you might be teaching are in high demand, it’s likely
that you may be asked to conduct more trainings than you can possibly
have the bandwidth for. Because of this, as you’re designing larger
courses it may be useful to consider developing a pipeline for tested,
shareable curricula that others can pick up and teach. The Carpentries
have a lovely model for this type of sharing that we’d like to take a
moment to discuss here.</p>
<p>The Carpentries community develops open source lessons, which can
always be updated and may never be <em>finished</em>. A lesson can
undergo many iterations before it reaches a relatively stable state. To
reflect this, we encourage lesson developers to indicate the status of
their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life
cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the pre-alpha stage.

<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still
being constructed.</li>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the
original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by
instructors who have not been significantly involved in its developed to
this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by
the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and
unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although your lesson will probably remain in pre-alpha throughout
this training, some of the content will be equally valuable at later
stages and we will also point you towards resources to help with testing
the lesson and gathering feedback.</p>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
          g.async=true; g.src='https://cdn.matomo.cloud/carpentries.matomo.cloud/matomo.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g,s);
        })();
