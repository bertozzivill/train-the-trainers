<p>There are many people who love teaching and want to be in the
classroom, but who have not yet learned the skills to teach effectively.
On the flip side, there are people who do not have a particular passion
for teaching, but who are still excellent instructors. These people have
learned the techniques and practices of effective instruction. Even if
you never love teaching, you can employ the skills you’re about to learn
to provide the best possible experience for both you and your
students.</p>

<p>Imagine that one day, a child draws a picture of a tree. He shows it
to his older sister, his mother, and his aunt.</p>
<p>His older sister says, “That’s a terrible drawing, you’re bad at
art.”</p>
<p>His mother says, “That drawing is perfect!! You’re an amazing
artist!”</p>
<p>His aunt says, “This is so good! I love the details around the
leaves. I bet it would look beautiful next time if you tried putting
some darker shading behind the trunk.”</p>
<p>How do you think the child felt after receiving each of these three
pieces of feedback?</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The exercise above showed people giving three different types of
feedback. The sister gave harsh negative feedback, claiming that the
child was categorically bad at art. The mother gave gushing positive
feedback, claiming that the child was categorically good at art. The
aunt gave some positive feedback, while also gently suggesting ways that
the child might improve in the future.</p>
<p>The child’s mother and sister were both demonstrating what
psychologist Carol Dweck calls a <strong>fixed mindset</strong>. This is
the belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made. The
child’s aunt, on the other hand, was demonstrating the belief that
ability can be acquired through effort– a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>. Especially when learning something that feels complex
or intimidating, a fixed mindset can interfere with motivation and
growth in a number of ways, as laid out in this diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/perquiro_growth.png" alt="Fixed vs Growth Mindsets." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.</div>

learners, and the best way to do so is to embody a growth mindset
yourself. Let’s go through a few common challenges instructors encounter
and consider how we might bring a growth mindset to them.</p>

<li>A learner asks you a question you don’t know the answer to.</li>
<li>You’re doing a live coding demonstration, and your code throws an
error when you didn’t expect it to.</li>
<li>You’re helping someone write a few lines of code, but they’re a slow

<p>We’ll go into more detail about how to cultivate a growth mindset in
the classroom next week. But for now, let’s spend a little time
cultivating a growth mindset in ourselves by practicing giving and
receiving feedback.</p>
</section><section id="ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"><h2 class="section-heading">ASK for Feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are many metaphors and acronyms designed to help people give
good feedback. One of our favorites is called the ASK framework. It
recommends that any feedback you provide to someone should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actionable</strong>: If you critique someone on something
they have no power to change, your feedback has limited power to help
them grow. Furthermore, they may wind up feeling demotivated, or even
defensive. Stick to the possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Specific</strong>: “Make it better” is actionable feedback,
but it doesn’t really help guide someone towards a better product. It’s
much more helpful to specify where, how, and why you’re recommending
changes. For example, “I think the narrative is clearer if you switch
these two paragraphs”, or “on line 76, you’re taking the median value of
your data, but it would be more appropriate to take the mean”.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kind</strong>: Even if you strongly dislike the thing you’re
critiquing, it’s likely that someone spent a lot of time and effort on
it. If you have ever had someone absolutely rip apart something
meaningful to you, you know how crushing it can be. Think about the
words you use. If you’re speaking to someone directly, think about your
body language and tone. Remember what it felt like the last time someone
was gentle with you. There are two sub-strategies that work well to
support kind feedback:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Good news first</em>: Start by talking about the aspects of the
work you enjoyed, and acknowledging the effort that went into it. This
helps the feedback receiver to feel secure and open to receiving more
critical comments.</li>
<li>
<em>“I” statements</em>: When you are, for example, reviewing a
paper, sometimes it’s tempting to say “this section is confusing.” But
you don’t actually know that for sure! It was confusing to you, but
clearly it made sense to the person who wrote it, and maybe it would
also make sense to someone else. When you give feedback, instead
consider saying “I was confused by this section because…” and continue
with actionable, specific feedback. This is both a more true reflection
of your critique, and a kinder way of providing comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></section><section id="ask-to-ask"><h2 class="section-heading">Ask to ASK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-to-ask"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There’s another reason we love the acronym ASK for feedback: it
reminds us that the giving of feedback should always be preceded by a
<em>question</em>. Usually, someone asks you for feedback, but
occasionally it’s also appropriate for you to ask someone if they would
like your opinion. Ideally, requests to receive or give feedback should
also follow the ASK protocol. For example, say “Hey, I made a figure for
a paper but I’m not sure if it’s easy to understand, could you tell me
what story this plot tells you?” instead of “What do you think of this
plot?” This will help guide the feedback-giver toward the actual type of
advice you’re hoping to receive.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even when feedback is actively solicited and given in the kindest
possible way, it can feel terrible to receive. Many of us, especially
those of us who grew up with a fixed mindset, often want our first try
to be perfect. When someone gives us tips on how to improve, we can feel
humiliated, defensive, and demotivated, because we have not lived up to
the standard we set for ourselves.</p>
<p>The process of sitting with and moving past the discomfort that comes
with feedback is a crucial component of developing a growth mindset.
Everyone develops their own strategy to work through this. Here’s an
example of how one of your instructors does it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For a few minutes, let myself feel whatever I need to. That person
just didn’t <em>understand</em> me! What do <em>they</em> know anyway?
Oh no, am I <em>terrible at this</em>? What if I’m <em>never</em>
successful?</li>
<li>Start to “reality test” those high-emotion thoughts. Do I really
think the person who gave me feedback didn’t know what they were talking
about? Do I really think that I’m bad at this, or am I proud of the
effort I put in? Don’t I want to learn how to do better? Isn’t the only
way to be successful to keep trying?</li>
<li>When I’m ready, sit back down with the feedback and really think
through it. What good points did this person make? What feedback can I
respectfully decline? It’s usually at this point that I actually start
getting excited about incorporating the feedback, because I can see how
it will make my work stronger.</li>
<li>Continue incorporating and refining the feedback. At this point I’m
usually really happy and grateful that I asked for help. If I can, I’ll
thank the person who gave me feedback. I might feel kind of silly for
how I responded before, but I know that it’s a human response that will
happen again. I trust myself to handle it appropriately next time it
happens.</li>

<p>We will now get started with a discussion of how learning works. We
will begin with some key concepts from educational research and identify
how these principles are put into practice in Carpentries workshops.</p>
<section id="the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"><h2 class="section-heading">The Carpentries Pedagogical Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
Following them, in this course we take an applied approach, avoiding the
theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and
providing hands-on practice, we develop learners’ confidence and lay the
foundation for future learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>a workshop is an interactive event</strong> –
for learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout
the course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
workshop is not simply a source of information; it is the starting point
for development of a new skill. To understand what this means, we will
start by exploring what research tells us about skill acquisition and
development of a “mental model.”</p>
</section><section id="the-acquisition-of-skill"><h2 class="section-heading">The Acquisition of Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-acquisition-of-skill"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a data visualization workshop
might never have made a plot using code, and may have no understanding
of how to load data into an R or Python workspace, much less visualize
it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a data visualization
workshop might have used <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>matplotlib</code>
before and knows how to generate common plots (line, scatter, bar) using
default color schemes, but may not know how to customize appearance,
labeling, color, or faceting.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that
are out of the ordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a data visualization workshop may have
extensive experience creating high-quality plots for publication and
presentation, as well as an understanding of visualization theory. When
presented with complex data to visualize, they may immediately come up
with creative ideas to tell an effective story.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in a
few episodes. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is often our primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

</h3>
<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarized by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential
to generate misconceptions that may interfere with learning.</p>

<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to
say:</p>
<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –
inspiring a comparison with something concrete, hands on, practical, and
useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organization: to support
computational skill development among working practitioners who need the
right tools and practices to be effective day to day.</p>

<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualize a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organizers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organize these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>
<p>The concept map below illustrates a simple mental model that a young
child might develop after putting the ball in the water.</p>

<p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>

</h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanzania.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that humid air causes malaria, or that seasons are
related to the shape of the earth’s orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in workshops. While teaching, we want to expose learners’
broken models so that we can help them begin to deconstruct them and
build better ones in their place.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not immediately used to guide further progress and are
hence called <strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?

a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides
valuable insight.</p>

<p>Each of these incorrect answers has <strong>diagnostic
power</strong>: each of the wrong choices helps the instructor figure
out precisely what misconceptions learners have adopted when they select
that choice. Each answer looks like it could be right. Silly answers

are wrong in random ways.</p>
<p>Formative assessments are most powerful when:</p>

particular concept. Using formative assessment effectively to discover

reflective practice.</p>

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>
</section><section id="the-importance-of-going-slowly"><h2 class="section-heading">The Importance of Going Slowly<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-going-slowly"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Learners coming to data science workshops may be novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they

</div>
<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the <a href="TODO">data visualization training Gloria Shirima ran in
Kigali</a>, we only covered two types of plot (line and scatter) for
three hours of teaching. An hour and a half per command may seem
glacially slow, but that course’s real purpose was to teach learners
about the fundamental theory of plot creation, especially the concepts
of layers and aesthetic mappings. From that foundation, constructing
more involved and complex plots will be much easier.</p>
<p>That mental model of ggplot also includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating informative variable names (so you can differentiate
between a multiple of plots in one script).</li>
<li>Writing code in scripts rather than the console (to ensure you don’t
lose it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning consists of more than “just” adding information to mental
models; creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as
important. Telling people that they should name things nicely and
consistently, and that they should focus on the location and protection
of the code they write, both set the stage for discussing of code
hygiene and replicability. We’re laying foundations of the practices we
want to promote even when not discussing them directly.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training, we will use a modified version of Nicholl’s five phase
paradigm for curriculum design<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nicholls’ paradigm describes a process,
commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish
to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their
learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the
lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum
design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated
outcomes. The Carpentries developed the modified version of Nicholls’
system that we will use in this workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching</li>
<li>Evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives</li>

<em>formative</em>, rather than <em>summative</em>, assessments. Because
of the shorter nature of the course we focus on assessing and modifying
progress <em>while the teaching is still going on</em>, to give
instructors opportunities to evaluate the teaching and lesson content
before the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>We will conduct a small summative assessment in the form of an exit
survey that you will complete at the end of the session. This final
survey will help us iterate and refine the content as a whole for future
trainings.</p>
<p>Note the cyclical nature of the lesson design process: you will
complete one iteration through this cycle during this training. Note
also that <em>teaching the content</em> is an essential intermediate
step in the process: the importance of feedback gathered while teaching
the lesson will be a common refrain throughout this training.</p>

<p>Over these two weeks, we will be focusing on helping you develop a
single short lesson to teach the fundamentals of curriculum design.
However, these same skills can be used to build out a much more
extensive curriculum (like the one you’re learning now). And because so
many of the skills you might be teaching are in high demand, it’s likely
that you may be asked to conduct more trainings than you can possibly
have the bandwidth for. Because of this, as you’re designing larger
courses it may be useful to consider developing a pipeline for tested,
shareable curricula that others can pick up and teach. The Carpentries
have a lovely model for this type of sharing that we’d like to take a
moment to discuss here.</p>
<p>The Carpentries community develops open source lessons, which can
always be updated and may never be <em>finished</em>. A lesson can
undergo many iterations before it reaches a relatively stable state. To
reflect this, we encourage lesson developers to indicate the status of
their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life
cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the pre-alpha stage. It enters alpha when it is taught for the first time. In beta, it is taught by other instructors. A full release of the lesson is made when it is stable. Pilot workshops take place during the alpha and beta phases." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The life cycle of a lesson</div>
</figure><p>Each life cycle stage indicates the level of maturity of a
lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still
being constructed.</li>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the
original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by
instructors who have not been significantly involved in its developed to
this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by
the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and
unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although your lesson will probably remain in pre-alpha throughout
this training, some of the content will be equally valuable at later
stages and we will also point you towards resources to help with testing
the lesson and gathering feedback.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to
define the scope of the lesson, i.e. what people need to know before and
what they will know after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the
target audience will help you with this and defining desired learning
outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently displaying a
description of the target audience will also help attract people with
the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your
workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target
audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to
the skills taught by your lesson. Recall our conversation from last
section about the <a href="skill-models-misconceptions.html">three
different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner,
and expert</a> and how it directly correlates to the complexity of
mental models these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not
know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or
how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of
the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who
can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can
immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a
new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level
of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This
can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior
knowledge<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what
<em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that
misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners
try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model. (More on
this in <a href="formative-assessment.html"><em>Stay On
Target</em></a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught
differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that
include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e. focused on a
specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but
without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant.
However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent
practitioners who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of
something they already have the prior knowledge of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For learners at this
level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners
the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are
likely to be more effective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the
motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of
your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems
they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see
the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson
will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the
literature).</p>
<p>We will look more at strategies to establish value and build positive
expectancies in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="be-specific">Be Specific<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-specific"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms,
for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at “PhD students” or
“early career researchers”. However, taking the time to focus on real
people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will
help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence
how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you
notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience
are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you
are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with
different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of
expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a
wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for
the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too
little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the
lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too
much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of
learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of
your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson,
alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you
expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you
have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners
when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic
questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the
answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended
audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with
caution: people are often bad at self-assessment i.e. estimating our own
ability to perform a task<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We can try to mitigate for this when
designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room
for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience
suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop
falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It
can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like
this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development
process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to
determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the
lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be
included.</p>
<section id="why-focus-on-skills"><h2 class="section-heading">Why Focus on Skills?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-focus-on-skills"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels
relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills
rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are
empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to
them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them
to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you
prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the
biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section id="learning-objectives"><h2 class="section-heading">Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson
should be new skills, i.e. things that the learner can do. For the vast
majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things
learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds
of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making
sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static
website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we
can <em>apply</em> concepts and <em>create</em> something new, we must
attain the ability to <em>remember</em> and <em>distinguish</em> between
new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are
often faster to gain then applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can
move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why
the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners
will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the
outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to
focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for
learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss
anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that
could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one)
skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written
in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner
has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills
described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule,
action verbs such as “explain,” “choose,” or “predict,” are more helpful
than passive verbs such as “know,” “understand,” or “appreciate”, which
are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" class="external-link">Bloom’s
Taxonomy</a>, which divides cognitive skills into several categories.
The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict hierarchy,
which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these skills
conform to such a hierarchy, Bloom’s Taxonomy serves as a very useful
bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.</p>
<p>We will see how helpful it can be to use action verbs in learning
objectives when we begin talking about exercise design in the coming
episodes.</p>

goals: <em>SMART</em>. Originally <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf" class="external-link">proposed
to aid managers in the definition of business goals</a>, and updated and
adapted since to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Common_usage" class="external-link">several
other domains</a> including education (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944406/" class="external-link"><em>How to
Write Well-Defined Learning Objectives</em></a> for example<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), the
SMART acronym requires goals to be <em>specific</em>,
<em>measurable</em>, <em>attainable</em>, <em>relevant</em>, and
<em>time-bound</em>.</p>
<p>In the context of a lesson, SMART objectives should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular
skill or ability the learner should have.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and
ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in
the objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be
able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a
workshop/by following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall
topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe
within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is
built into the approach described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for any lesson/curriculum that will be taught in a fixed
amount of time, <em>attainable</em> and <em>time-bound</em> are
overlapping: learning objectives for your lesson will answer the
question “What will learners be able to do by the end of this lesson?”
and the time available to teach the lesson, combined with the expected
prior knowledge of your target audience, will determine how attainable
they are.</p>

<p>Objective 1 is the closest to what we ideally want in a lesson
objective, but it illustrates how difficult it can be to make an
objective truly specific. For example, a more specific and measurable
version of this objective could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>write links, headings and bold and italicised text with
Markdown.</em></p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to
include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they
will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time
can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short
form training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often
need to be made about what can and cannot be included. Trying to fit too
much content into a lesson is counter-productive<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is good to
avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover
properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking
about this lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced
with a difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be
acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire “higher-level” cognitive
skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire
the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain.
Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless
you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the
relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably
unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its
end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes,
lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a
particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices
about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the
context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have discussed the importance of defining objectives early in the
lesson design process, and looked at some examples of objectives written
for other lessons. Now it is time to begin defining objectives for your
own.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 3-4 objectives for every 6 hours your lesson will take to
teach. (For example, this curriculum is designed to be taught in ~18
hours and has <a href="index.html#learning-objectives">ten learning
objectives</a>.)</li>
<li>These objectives are for your lesson as a whole: try to define the
“end point” knowledge and skills you want learners to acquire. You can
think of these as the things you would test in a fictional “final exam”
your learners would be able to tackle.</li>
<li>Later you will write “episode-level” objectives that should define
intermediate steps towards the high-level objectives you identify for
your lesson here.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a simplified model of memory individuals are equipped with two
types of memory: working (also called short-term) and long-term.
Long-term memory essentially has unlimited storage but is slow to
access, whereas working memory is quicker to access but can only hold a
limited number of items at a time. For teaching, the goal is to help
learners move the new things they’ve learned from working memory into
long-term memory. One of the ways lesson developers can aid in this
process is through exercises.</p>
<p>In addition to checking for misconceptions and broken mental models,
exercises help move new skills and concepts into long-term memory by
providing learners an opportunity to practice what was recently learned.
These exercises should occur frequently throughout the lesson because
they move items to long-term memory and free up learners’ working memory
for new items.</p>
<p>Creating exercises builds upon the learning objectives you created
earlier in the lesson design process. You can design exercises based on
the actions/skills you described in your learning objectives (the
learning outcomes you intend for the lesson). This will be easier if
your wrote learning objectives with specific action verbs. Specific
verbs can help you decide what action you want the learners to perform
in the exercise. E.g. actions such as “explain” and “describe” may be
better assessed by discussions and multiple choice questions, while
“solve,” “construct,” “test” and other higher-level cognitive skills may
be better assessed by debugging tasks, <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#code-run" class="external-link">code-and-run</a>,

<li>Would this type of exercise be suited to a novice audience? Or is it
a better fit for intermediate or advanced learners?</li>
<li>Would this kind of exercise work well in an in-person workshop
setting? Would it be better suited to self-directed learning and/or a
virtual workshop?</li>

<p>Share the major points of your discussion in the collaborative notes
document.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you discussed with your group in the last exercise, different
types of learning objectives work better for novices, while others are a
better fit for competent practitioners or experts.</p>
<p>This can be understood in terms of the types of exercises that suit
the objective: exercise types that help manage cognitive load for the
learner, such as <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#fill-in-the-blanks" class="external-link">fill-in-the-blanks</a>,
<a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#faded-examples" class="external-link">faded
examples</a> or <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#parsons-problem" class="external-link">Parsons
problems</a> (which all provide a lot of the guiding process/scaffolding
code and allow the learner to focus on a specific concept or skill) are
a good fit for a novice, to whom all elements of the topic are new.
However, these kinds of exercise do not provide an opportunity for
learners to develop higher-level skills, such as the ability to create
whole new functions or scripts, or to extrapolate from the examples they
have seen to solve a different kind of problem. Indeed, example and
exercise types that are helpful to novices may even be
counter-productive for learners with a greater level of expertise<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus you want to choose your objectives to fit your intended audience
and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.</p>

Objective (30 minutes)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exercise-assessing-progress-towards-an-objective-30-minutes"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Using one of the exercise formats you have learned about so far,
design an exercise that will require learners to perform one of the
actions described in the objectives you wrote earlier, and that assesses
their ability to do so.</p>
<p>These should be assessments of the lower-level objectives defined for
individual episodes in the lesson, as opposed to the lesson-level
objectives you wrote first.</p>
<p>Trainees working as a team can choose whether to work together on
discussing and designing a single exercise to assess a single objective,
or to divide their efforts and each focus on an exercise for their own
episode. If you choose to take the latter approach and finish with time
to spare, spend the remainder reviewing and providing feedback on one
another’s assessments.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>The same approach to designing exercises within a lesson can also be
used to create a short “re-assessment” questionnaire for potential
learners to complete when they register for a workshop teaching the
lesson (or for self-evaluation before following the lesson on their
own). You can use <a href="audience.html#defining-prerequisite-knowledge">the list of
prerequisite knowledge that you defined earlier</a> to help with
this.</p>
<p>If you collect the results of this questionnaire, use it to follow up
with people who have registered for the workshop but do not fit the
intended target audience, to manage their expectations about how useful
the workshop will be for them.</p>

defined for the lesson have been reached.</li>

address certain objectives.</li>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
