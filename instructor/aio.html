<li>was well-prepared to teach their subject;</li>
<li>shared a clear pathway for what and how they wanted you to
learn;</li>
<li>taught a subject that was interesting or useful for you;</li>
<li>made you feel actively engaged in the learning process;</li>
<li>made you feel challenged but not overwhelmed;</li>
<li>gave you space to ask questions or challenge them;</li>
<li>made you feel safe;</li>
<li>didn’t shame you for lack of knowledge;</li>
<li>was responsive to your needs;</li>
<li>wasn’t condescending;</li>
<li>assumed that you had potential;</li>
<li>acknowledged your growth;</li>
<li>provided kind and useful feedback.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal over the next two weeks is to equip you with foundational
knowledge and practice about learning and teaching. We hope that these
first steps will set you up well to grow as an instructor in the years
to come.</p>

<p>There are many people who love teaching and want to be in the
classroom, but who have not yet learned the skills to teach effectively.
On the flip side, there are people who do not have a particular passion

learned the techniques and practices of effective instruction. Even if
you never love teaching, you can employ the skills you’re about to learn
to provide the best possible experience for both you and your

<p>This workshop will teach you how to design and execute on a
curriculum from start to finish. Over the course of the coming week, you
will learn how to identify your target audience, determine what content
to teach, and create an assessment-based curriculum for that content.
Because much of our work involves programming, you will also learn how
to effectively teach using the live coding method. You should have
formed yourselves into groups of three– is anyone not part of a group
yet?</p>
<p>Over the course of the workshop, when you see a section labeled
<strong>Group Work</strong>, it’s a sign for you to assemble with your
group members to develop a new part of your curriculum.</p>
<p>On Thursday and Friday of next week, each group will take us through
their lesson. You will have <strong>30 minutes total</strong> to
introduce your topic, teach it with live coding, and deliver a brief
assessment. Afterwards we will have 10 minutes of feedback before moving
on to the next group. This is a short amount of time, so the topic of
your curriculum must be very concise. We will work together to pick an
appropriate topic for each group.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>This is a mixed course, with participants who are most comfortable in
either Python or R. In order to run R scripts, everyone should have
downloaded and installed R and RStudio yesterday. And luckily, RStudio
can also function as a development environment for Python, so we
shouldn’t need to download Python separately. What we will need to do is
install the R package that will help us run Python, as well as a few
Python packages.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="reticulate">
<code>reticulate</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#reticulate"></a>
</h3>
<p>You can run Python code from an R session using an R package called
<code>reticulate</code>. Make sure you have <code>reticulate</code>
installed, either using the GUI or by running
<code>install.packages("reticulate")</code> from the RStudio
console.</p>
<p>Now, open a new R script and name it “install_python_packages.R”. On
the first line, type <code><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/" class="external-link">library(reticulate)</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="python-packages">Python packages<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#python-packages"></a>
</h3>
<p>Like R, Python has a robust system of libraries that need to be
installed and loaded before they can be used. We can use our R script to
install these packages using the <code>reticulate</code> function
<code>py_install()</code>.</p>
<p>On a lower line of your R script, type:</p>
<pre><code><span><span class="fu">py_install</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="fu">c</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"pandas"</span>, <span class="st">"seaborn"</span>, <span class="st">"matplotlib"</span><span class="op">)</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This should install the most commonly used data science and plotting
packages used in Python. If you ever have trouble with a package
loading, or you need to install a new package, we can come back and
rerun or modify this script.</p>
<div id="note-for-python-users" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>

<div id="note-for-python-users" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Note for Python Users<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#note-for-python-users"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Even if you are a Python user who already has these packages
installed, you will need to install them again using py_install. This is
because <code>reticulate</code> creates a virtual environment to run
Python from R, so it doesn’t interfere with the instance of Python
running on your main machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="testing-your-installation">Testing Your Installation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#testing-your-installation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Now, open a new file, but instead of opening an R script, scroll down
and create a Python script. Name it “test_install.py”. In the file, type
the following code:</p>
<pre><code>import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

print("Hello world")</code></pre>
<p>Raise your hand if you run into any errors and we will work through
them with you.</p>

<p>Imagine that one day, a child draws a picture of a tree. He shows it
to his older sister, his mother, and his aunt.</p>
<p>His older sister says, “That’s a terrible drawing, you’re bad at
art.”</p>
<p>His mother says, “That drawing is perfect!! You’re an amazing
artist!”</p>
<p>His aunt says, “This is so good! I love the details around the
leaves. I bet it would look beautiful next time if you tried putting
some darker shading behind the trunk.”</p>
<p>How do you think the child felt after receiving each of these three
pieces of feedback?</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The exercise above showed people giving three different types of
feedback. The sister gave harsh negative feedback, claiming that the
child was categorically bad at art. The mother gave gushing positive
feedback, claiming that the child was categorically good at art. The
aunt gave some positive feedback, while also gently suggesting ways that
the child might improve in the future.</p>
<p>The child’s mother and sister were both demonstrating what
psychologist Carol Dweck calls a <strong>fixed mindset</strong>. This is
the belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made. The
child’s aunt, on the other hand, was demonstrating the belief that
ability can be acquired through effort– a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>. Especially when learning something that feels complex
or intimidating, a fixed mindset can interfere with motivation and
growth in a number of ways, as laid out in this diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/perquiro_growth.png" alt="Fixed vs Growth Mindsets." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.</div>
</figure><p>It’s important for you to try and encourage a growth mindset in your
learners, and the best way to do so is to embody a growth mindset
yourself. Let’s go through a few common challenges instructors encounter
and consider how we might bring a growth mindset to them.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>How might someone with a fixed mindset respond to each of these
common challenges? What about someone with a growth mindset?</p>
<ul>
<li>A learner asks you a question you don’t know the answer to.</li>
<li>You’re doing a live coding demonstration, and your code throws an
error when you didn’t expect it to.</li>
<li>You’re helping someone write a few lines of code, but they’re a slow
typer. It would be faster if you took their computer and did it yourself
as they watched.</li>
<li>A student is feeling frustrated and tells you, “I’m just no good at
coding!”.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>We’ll go into more detail about how to cultivate a growth mindset in
the classroom next week. But for now, let’s spend a little time
cultivating a growth mindset in ourselves by practicing giving and
receiving feedback.</p>
</section><section id="ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"><h2 class="section-heading">ASK for Feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are many metaphors and acronyms designed to help people give
good feedback. One of our favorites is called the ASK framework. It
recommends that any feedback you provide to someone should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actionable</strong>: If you critique someone on something
they have no power to change, your feedback has limited power to help
them grow. Furthermore, they may wind up feeling demotivated, or even
defensive. Stick to the possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Specific</strong>: “Make it better” is actionable feedback,
but it doesn’t really help guide someone towards a better product. It’s
much more helpful to specify where, how, and why you’re recommending
changes. For example, “I think the narrative is clearer if you switch
these two paragraphs”, or “on line 76, you’re taking the median value of
your data, but it would be more appropriate to take the mean”.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kind</strong>: Even if you strongly dislike the thing you’re
critiquing, it’s likely that someone spent a lot of time and effort on
it. If you have ever had someone absolutely rip apart something
meaningful to you, you know how crushing it can be. Think about the
words you use. If you’re speaking to someone directly, think about your
body language and tone. Remember what it felt like the last time someone
was gentle with you. There are two sub-strategies that work well to
support kind feedback:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Good news first</em>: Start by talking about the aspects of the
work you enjoyed, and acknowledging the effort that went into it. This
helps the feedback receiver to feel secure and open to receiveing more
critical comments.</li>
<li>
<em>“I” statements</em>: When you are, for example, reviewing a
paper, sometimes it’s tempting to say “this section is confusing.” But
you don’t actually know that for sure! It was confusing to you, but
clearly it made sense to the person who wrote it, and maybe it would
also make sense to someone else. When you give feedback, instead
consider saying “I was confused by this section because…” and continue
with actionable, specific feedback. This is both a more true reflection
of your critique, and a kinder way of providing comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></section><section id="ask-to-ask"><h2 class="section-heading">Ask to ASK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-to-ask"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There’s another reason we love the acronym ASK for feedback: it
reminds us that the giving of feedback should always be preceded by a
<em>question</em>. Usually, someone asks you for feedback, but
occasionally it’s also appropriate for you to ask someone if they would
like your opinion. Ideally, requests to receive or give feedback should
also follow the ASK protocol. For example, say “Hey, I made a figure for
a paper but I’m not sure if it’s easy to understand, could you tell me
what story this plot tells you?” instead of “What do you think of this
plot?” This will help guide the feedback-giver toward the actual type of
advice you’re hoping to receive.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even when feedback is actively solicited and given in the kindest
possible way, it can feel terrible to receive. Many of us, especially
those of us who grew up with a fixed mindset, often want our first try
to be perfect. When someone gives us tips on how to improve, we can feel
humiliated, defensive, and demotivated, because we have not lived up to
the standard we set for ourselves.</p>
<p>The process of sitting with and moving past the discomfort that comes
with feedback is a crucial component of developing a growth mindset.
Everyone develops their own strategy to work through this. Here’s an
example of how one of your instructors does it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For a few minutes, let myself feel whatever I need to. That person
just didn’t <em>understand</em> me! What do <em>they</em> know anyway?
Oh no, am I <em>terrible at this</em>? What if I’m <em>never</em>
successful?</li>
<li>Start to “reality test” those high-emotion thoughts. Do I really
think the person who gave me feedback didn’t know what they were talking
about? Do I really think that I’m bad at this, or am I proud of the
effort I put in? Don’t I want to learn how to do better? Isn’t the only
way to be successful to keep trying?</li>
<li>When I’m ready, sit back down with the feedback and really think
through it. What good points did this person make? What feedback can I
respectfully decline? It’s usually at this point that I actually start
getting excited about incorporating the feedback, because I can see how
it will make my work stronger.</li>
<li>Continue incorporating and refining the feedback. At this point I’m
usually really happy and grateful that I asked for help. If I can, I’ll
thank the person who gave me feedback. I might feel kind of silly for
how I responded before, but I know that it’s a human response that will
happen again. I trust myself to handle it appropriately next time it
happens.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training, we will use a modified version of Nicholl’s five phase
paradigm for curriculum design<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nicholls’ paradigm describes a process,
commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish
to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their
learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the
lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum
design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated
outcomes.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Select learning outcomes</li>
<li>Choose learning experiences to help learners achieve these
outcomes</li>
<li>Develop content to support these experiences</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards desired outcomes</li>
<li>Evaluate chosen outcomes, experiences, and content based on this
assessment</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/nicholls-five-phases.svg" style="width:67.0%" alt="A flow diagram presenting the Nicholls' five phases of curriculum design as a cycle." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Nicholls’ five phases of curriculum design,
presented as a cycle to reflect that all aspects of the design should be
revisited in response to the results of the evaluation that takes place
at step 5.</div>
</figure><p>The last two phases of Nicholls’ paradigm involve assessing learner
progress towards the desired learning outcomes and evaluating the stated
objectives and current content in light of the results of that
assessment. In The Carpentries, most workshops are relatively
short-format, without room for an extensive assessment after the
teaching has finished (a <em>summative</em> assessment). To account for
this, our lessons place an emphasis on <em>formative</em> assessment:
assessment of learner progress that takes place <em>while the teaching
is still going on</em>, to give instructors opportunities to evaluate
the teaching and lesson content before the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>To account for this, we have adapted Nicholls’ five phases in this
training, to place an emphasis on assessing learning during a
workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching</li>
<li>(After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to
define the scope of the lesson, i.e. what people need to know before and
what they will know after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the
target audience will help you with this and defining desired learning
outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently displaying a
description of the target audience will also help attract people with
the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your
workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target
audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to
the skills taught by your lesson. In The Carpentries Instructor Training
curriculum, we describe <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#the-acquisition-of-skill" class="external-link">three
different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner,
and expert</a> and how it directly correlates to the complexity of <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
models</a> these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not
know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or
how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of
the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who
can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can
immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a
new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level
of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This
can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior
knowledge<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what
<em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that
misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners
try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model. (More on
this in <a href="formative-assessment.html"><em>Stay On
Target</em></a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught
differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that
include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e. focused on a
specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but
without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant.
However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent
practitioners who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of
something they already have the prior knowledge of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For learners at this
level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners
the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are
likely to be more effective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the
motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of
your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems
they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see
the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson
will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the
literature).</p>
<p>We will look more at strategies to establish value and build positive
expectancies in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="be-specific">Be Specific<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-specific"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms,
for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at “PhD students” or
“early career researchers”. However, taking the time to focus on real
people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will
help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence
how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you
notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience
are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you
are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with
different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of
expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a
wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for
the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too
little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the
lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too
much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of
learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of
your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson,
alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you
expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you
have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners
when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic
questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the
answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended
audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with
caution: people are often bad at self-assessment i.e. estimating our own
ability to perform a task<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We can try to mitigate for this when
designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room
for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience
suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop
falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

<p>We will now get started with a discussion of how learning works. We
will begin with some key concepts from educational research and identify
how these principles are put into practice in Carpentries workshops.</p>
<section id="the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"><h2 class="section-heading">The Carpentries Pedagogical Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-carpentries-pedagogical-model"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
We take an applied approach, avoiding the theoretical and general in
favor of the practical and specific. By showing learners how to solve
specific problems with specific tools and providing hands-on practice,
we develop learners’ confidence and lay the foundation for future
learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p><strong>A Carpentries workshop is an interactive event</strong> – for
learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout the
course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
Carpentries workshop is not simply a source of information; it is the
starting point for development of a new skill. To understand what this
means, we will start by exploring what research tells us about skill
acquisition and development of a “mental model.”</p>
</section><section id="the-acquisition-of-skill"><h2 class="section-heading">The Acquisition of Skill<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-acquisition-of-skill"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a Carpentries workshop might
never have heard of the bash shell, and therefore may have no
understanding of how it relates to their file system or other programs
on their computer.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a Carpentries workshop

directories and use individual programs, but they might not understand
how they can fit these programs together to build scripts and automate
large tasks.</p>

<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that

<p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
Instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in the
next episode. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is The Carpentries’ primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarized by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential

<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to
say:</p>
<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –
inspiring a comparison with something concrete, hands on, practical, and
useful. This clearly conveys the purpose of our organization: to support
computational skill development among working practitioners who need the

<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualize a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organizers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organize these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>

<p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>

</h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Vancouver is the capital of British Columbia.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that motion and acceleration must always be in the
same direction, or that seasons are related to the shape of the earth’s
orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in Carpentries workshops. While teaching, we want to
expose learners’ broken models so that we can help them begin to
deconstruct them and build better ones in their place.</p>

<p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an Instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not used to guide further progress and are hence called
<strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both Instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what Instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?
a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>
</section><section id="the-importance-of-going-slowly"><h2 class="section-heading">The Importance of Going Slowly<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-importance-of-going-slowly"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Most learners coming to Carpentries lessons are novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If someone feels it is too slow, they will be a bit bored. If they

Marwaha, SWC Instructor</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the first main episode of Software Carpentry’s <a href="https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/" class="external-link">lesson on the Unix
shell</a>, which covers “Navigating Files and Directories”, there are
only four “commands” for 40 minutes of teaching. Ten minutes per command
may seem glacially slow, but that episodes’s real purpose is to teach
learners about paths; later on, they will learn about history,
wildcards, pipes and filters, command-line arguments, redirection, and
all the other big ideas on which the shell depends, and without which
people cannot understand how to use commands.</p>
<p>That mental model of the shell also includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything you repeat manually, you will eventually get wrong (so let
the computer repeat things for you by using tab completion and the
<code>history</code> command).</li>
<li>Lots of little tools, combined as needed, are more productive than a
handful of programs. (This motivates the pipe-and-filter model.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two examples illustrate something else as well. Learning
consists of more than “just” adding information to mental models;
creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as important.
Telling people that they should not repeat things, and that they should
try to think (by analogy) in terms of little pieces loosely joined, both
set the stage for discussing functions. Explicitly referring back to
pipes and filters in the shell when introducing functions helps solidify
both ideas.</p>

<p>One of the strengths of Carpentries workshops is that we meet
learners <em>where they are</em>. Carpentries Instructors strive to help
learners progress from whatever starting point they happen to be at,
without making anyone feel inferior about their current practices or
skillsets. We do this in part by teaching relevant and useful skills,
building an inclusive learning environment, and continually getting (and
paying attention to!) feedback from learners. We will be talking in more
depth about each of these strategies as we go forward in our
workshop.</p>

our iterative design process: defining the skills and knowledge we want
learners to leave with.</div>
</figure><p>At this stage of the training, you should have a clear idea of who
the target audience is for your lesson, and what knowledge, skills, and
abilities you expect them to arrive with. Now it is time to consider the
additional knowledge, skills, and abilities they will have by the time
they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It
can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like
this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development
process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to
determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the
lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be
included.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels
relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills
rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are
empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to
them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them
to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you
prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the
biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section id="learning-objectives"><h2 class="section-heading">Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson
should be new skills, i.e. things that the learner can do. For the vast
majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things
learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds
of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making
sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static
website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we
can <em>apply</em> concepts and <em>create</em> something new, we must
attain the ability to <em>remember</em> and <em>distinguish</em> between
new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are
often faster to gain then applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can
move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why
the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners
will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the
outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to
focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for
learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss
anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that
could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>

</figure><p>Objectives can be defined for a lesson as a whole - what should

</div>
<p>These should be read as if they were endings to a sentence
beginning</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“At the end of this session, learners should be able to …”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one)
skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written
in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner
has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills
described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule,
action verbs such as “explain,” “choose,” or “predict,” are more helpful
than passive verbs such as “know,” “understand,” or “appreciate”, which
are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is [Bloom’s
Taxonomy][blooms], which divides cognitive skills into several
categories. The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict
hierarchy, which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these
skills conform to such a hierarchy, Bloom’s Taxonomy serves as a very
useful bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.</p>
<p>We will see how helpful it can be to use action verbs in learning
objectives when we begin talking about exercise design in the coming
episodes.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To assist you in defining and writing learning objectives for your
lesson, it can be helpful to turn to a popular framework for defining
goals: <em>SMART</em>. Originally <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf" class="external-link">proposed
to aid managers in the definition of business goals</a>, and updated and
adapted since to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Common_usage" class="external-link">several
other domains</a> including education (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944406/" class="external-link"><em>How to
Write Well-Defined Learning Objectives</em></a> for example<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), the
SMART acronym requires goals to be <em>specific</em>,
<em>measurable</em>, <em>attainable</em>, <em>relevant</em>, and
<em>time-bound</em>.</p>
<p>In the context of a lesson, SMART objectives should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular
skill or ability the learner should have.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and
ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in
the objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be
able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a
workshop/by following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall
topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe
within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is
built into the approach described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for any lesson/curriculum that will be taught in a fixed
amount of time, <em>attainable</em> and <em>time-bound</em> are
overlapping: learning objectives for your lesson will answer the
question “What will learners be able to do by the end of this lesson?”
and the time available to teach the lesson, combined with the expected
prior knowledge of your target audience, will determine how attainable
they are.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to
include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they
will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time
can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short
form training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often
need to be made about what can and cannot be included. Trying to fit too
much content into a lesson is counter-productive<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is good to
avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover
properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking
about this lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced
with a difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be
acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire “higher-level” cognitive
skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire
the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain.
Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless
you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the
relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably
unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its
end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes,
lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a
particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices
about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the
context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have discussed the importance of defining objectives early in the
lesson design process, and looked at some examples of objectives written
for other lessons. Now it is time to begin defining objectives for your
own.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 3-4 objectives for every 6 hours your lesson will take to
teach. (For example, this curriculum is designed to be taught in ~18
hours and has <a href="index.html#learning-objectives">ten learning
objectives</a>.)</li>
<li>These objectives are for your lesson as a whole: try to define the
“end point” knowledge and skills you want learners to acquire. You can
think of these as the things you would test in a fictional “final exam”
your learners would be able to tackle.</li>
<li>Later you will write “episode-level” objectives that should define
intermediate steps towards the high-level objectives you identify for
your lesson here.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to measure progress and evaluate if and what learning
occurred - we use various types of assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>summative assessments</strong> - used to verify whether
learners achieved the stated learning objectives after instruction.</li>
<li>
<strong>formative assessments</strong> - used to detect changes in
learner performance <em>during</em> instruction, to provide feedback and
insight into the learners’ developing mental models of the topic taught
and to identify any old or developing misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summative assessments</strong> sum up what learning has been
achieved after training (e.g. via exams). They give valuable data about
learning attainment by individuals and entire cohorts but are not used
to guide further progress. They may not be as suitable for short
courses, but may be necessary for those that give marks/grades or
certificates of completion.</p>
<p><strong>Formative assessments</strong> are applied throughout a
course and with several different purposes: they provide a way to move
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory.html#using-formative-assessment-to-support-memory-consolidation" class="external-link">new
information from working memory to long-term memory</a>; they can inform
instructors’ decisions about how to modify instruction to better promote
learning; they also inform learners about changes they may need to make
to improve their learning. Ideally, they should be used often
(e.g. after every 15-20 minutes of teaching), providing opportunities to
instructors to change pace and refocus learners’ attention. For short
courses, formative assessments are usually more valuable and easier to
implement in practice than summative assessments - they need not be
complex or time-consuming, just informative enough about learning for
both instructors and learners.</p>
<p>The most effective way to test learner understanding is to do such
assessments in class - they engage all learners and allow instructors to
check learners’ confidence with the content and its delivery, can help
you deal with any potential misunderstandings as soon as they arise, and
maximise the value of workshop for everyone. Such formative assessments
also help with <em>metacognition</em> - the awareness a learner has that
they are succeeding in learning something new.</p>
<p>Any instructional tool that generates feedback and is used in a
formative way to check for learners’ understanding can be described as
“formative assessment”. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>reflection</strong> at the end of a session to help process
learning - e.g. asking learners to write down things they learned,
things they want to know more about and any questions they still
have</li>
<li>
<strong>concept maps and diagrams</strong> - asking learners to
reflect by drawing/labeling a concept map/diagram or writing down a list
of new concepts and skills they’ve learned and (optionally) how they
relate to one another or connect with previous knowledge</li>
<li>
<strong>checking in</strong> - gauging learners’ satisfaction and
understanding using agreed signals (e.g. raising different coloured
post-it/sticky notes or <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/#reactions" class="external-link">Zoom
reactions</a> to indicate that the pace is too fast/slow, that they
completed/have not completed an exercise).</li>
<li>
<strong>think, pair, share</strong> - learners <em>think</em> about
an answer to a question, <em>pair</em> up with a classmate to discuss
their answer, and then <em>share</em> out the consensus they came to
with the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many other formative assessment tools can be found in Briggs’ list of
<a href="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/21-ways-to-check-for-student-understanding/" class="external-link">“21
ways to check for student understanding”</a> or Edutopia’s <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/groups/assessment/250941" class="external-link">“56 Examples of
Formative Assessment”</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong> are one important type of formative
assessment. We will now have a look into exercises that perform
misconception checks and ask students diagnostic questions; we will
cover a few other types of exercises that help with retaining new
knowledge in one of the later episodes.</p>

<p>An example misconception from everyday life (<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/instructor/02-practice-learning.html#misconceptions" class="external-link">borrowed
from The Carpentries Instructor Training</a>) is, knowing that a bigger
object (more volume) pushes out more water out of a basin than a smaller
object (less volume), assuming that the similar principle will apply for
objects of different weights. Surprisingly, heavier objects of the same
volume as lighter ones will not push out more water. <img src="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='Four sets of words inside rectangles, with labeled arrows connecting them. "Ball" is at the left, and "Water", at right. "Big Ball" and "Small Ball" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" are labeled with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball", and arrows to "Water" are labeled as "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out "LESS.

<p>Another misconception, sometimes encountered by people who are
learning programming languages such as R and Python having used
spreadsheets, is that variables in programs calculated by referencing
other variables in formulas will retain the connection and be updated
automatically when the referenced variables change. Variables in R or
Python programs can use other variables in calculations
(e.g. <code>a = b + 3</code>), but they do not behave like cells in
spreadsheets and updating the value of variable <code>b</code> after the
previous assignment will not change the value of <code>a</code>.</p>

<h4 id="copyright-licencing-example">Copyright / Licencing Example<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-licencing-example"></a>
</h4>
<p>Misconceptions often arise around topics of copyright and licencing
of work/content (e.g. data, software, written material). Copyright
allows a creator to state that they own the work they have created. This
declaration is optional - even if the creator does not explicitly assert
it, copyright of the work exists from the moment of creation. A licence
is a legal document which sets down the terms under which the creator is
releasing what they have created for others to use, modify, extend or
exploit. If this information is not provided, some will not reuse the
work at all while others will assume they are free to do whatever they
want with the work (as there is nothing to say that they cannot). This
former is the correct assumption, even if this was not the intention of
the copyright owner.</p>

<p><a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#using-formative-assessment-to-identify-misconceptions" class="external-link">Multiple
choice question (MCQ)</a> exercises are types of a formative assessment
that can help you target anticipated misconceptions. When designed
carefully, each incorrect answer in a MCQ will have diagnostic power and
provide valuable insight into how a mental model is broken. For example,
suppose we are teaching children multi-digit addition. An example of a
well-designed MCQ (<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#using-formative-assessment-to-identify-misconceptions" class="external-link">borrowed
from The Carpentries Instructor Training</a>) in this case could be:</p>
<p><em>MCQ: What is 27 + 15?</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>42</li>
<li>32</li>
<li>312</li>
<li>33</li>
</ol>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides a
valuable insight:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>they do not understand the concept of a carry and are throwing it
away completely</li>
<li>they understand the concept of a carry and know that they cannot
just discard the carried ‘1’, but do not understand that it is actually
a ten and needs to be added into the next column - they are treating
each column of numbers as unconnected to its neighbours.</li>
<li>they understand that they need to carry ‘1’ but are adding it to the
wrong column.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their diagnostic power means that each of the wrong choices helps an
instructor figure out precisely what misconceptions learners had adopted
and in which ways their mental models are broken. As a result the
instructor may decide to review a particular concept or change the pace
of instruction. At the same time, learners get feedback about what they
have misunderstood and what they need to focus their study efforts on -
we call this <strong>guided practice</strong>.</p>

</h3>
<p>When using a multiple choice question for formative assessment, the
incorrect answers you provide as options are <em>at least as
important</em> as the correct answer because they offer the most useful
insight into the mental model your audience is building. But choosing
incorrect answers can be difficult, especially early in a lesson where
you are more likely to encounter misconceptions that learners have
arrived with as opposed to those they have picked up while following the
lesson.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>When identifying plausible distractors, it is essential to consider
the prior knowledge you expect learners to have of your lesson
topic.</p>
<p>The plausible distractors in the MCQ example above are chosen on the
assumption that learners have been taught addition by “carrying”
numbers: the incorrect answers are designed to diagnose misconceptions
associated with that method.</p>
<p>However, as <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/instructor-training/issues/1403" class="external-link">pointed
out by Maneesha Sane</a>, if a learner has been taught to add numbers by
another method, e.g. first rounding them up or down to values that are
more easy to remember and combine (e.g. 27 to 30), they might have
misconceptions that cause them to arrive at an answer that is incorrect
but not represented in the MCQ options.</p>

<p>Thinking back of the misconceptions of how values are assigned,
referenced and updated in programming languages, here is an example MCQ
that can probe learners for such misconceptions.</p>
<p><em>MCQ: Look at the following 3 assignment statements in
Python.</em></p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">PYTHON<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a>n <span class="op">=</span> <span class="op">-</span><span class="dv">100</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p><em>What is the result at the end of the above assignments?</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>n = 300 and m = 300</li>
<li>n = -100 and m = -100</li>
<li>n = 200 and m = 300</li>
<li>n = -100 and m = 300</li>
</ol>
<p>The correct answer is d., while plausible distractors identify
different misconceptions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>they understand the value held by <code>n</code> is now also held by
<code>m</code> but do not understand the value of <code>n</code> has
been updated since the initial assignment (e.g. treating it as a
constant).</li>
<li>they do not understand <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> are
separate variables/containers for values (which can hold the same
values) but rather assume that <code>m</code> is referencing variable
<code>n</code> instead of copying its value at the time of assignment
(e.g. behaving as a reference to another cell in a spreadsheet).</li>
<li>they think that the reassignment for <code>n</code> actually
subtracts <code>100</code> from the original value.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="copyright-licencing-mcq">Copyright / Licencing MCQ<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#copyright-licencing-mcq"></a>
</h4>
<p>An example MCQ to check on people’s misconceptions around licencing
and reusing other people’s work could be designed as follows.</p>
<p><em>MCQ: Which of the following statements are true and which are
false?</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>I don’t need permission because I am only using the copyrighted work
in educational or non-profit purposes<br>
</li>
<li>I should always know the licence of any code, data, libraries,
pictures or other work that you reuse or redistribute<br>
</li>
<li>Since I’m planning to give credit to the authors who created the
work I reuse, I do not have to worry about or need permission<br>
</li>
<li>Material I obtain from the Internet is publicly accessible so no
explicit permission is required<br>
</li>
<li>The work I want to use does not have a copyright notice on it, so
it’s not protected by copyright and I’m free to use it</li>
</ol>
<p>The correct answers are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>False - you always need an explicit permission from the creator to
use their work.<br>
</li>
<li>True - you should make sure that you have the permission for all the
work that you are reusing, modifying or sharing.<br>
</li>
<li>False - if you give credit to a work’s owner, that only means you
are not plagiarising other people’s work and claiming it as your own,
however that does not mean that you have the permission to use it.<br>
</li>
<li>False - publicly accessible work is not the same the work in the
public domain. The owner explicitly must put their work in the public
domain but attaching the appropriate licence to it, before you can
freely reuse it.</li>
<li>False - the use of copyright notice is optional as copyright exists
implicitly from the moment the work is created.</li>
</ol>
<p>To help identify plausible distractors, you can think about problems
or questions from previous training events and what people struggled
with, think about your own misconceptions in the past, or ask colleagues
about their experiences. It is important to consider [<em>expert
awareness gap</em>][expert-awareness-gap-instructor-training], the
phenomenon where experts in a topic forget what it is like not to have a
good mental model of it. Observing how others learn your topic and
asking colleagues to review lesson content as you design it can help
mitigate this.</p>
<p>You should aim to create all your assessments before you have written
the explanatory content of your lesson (recall Nicholl’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design" class="external-link">backward
design</a>). These assessments will guide your lesson design process by
knowing exactly which knowledge you’d expect from your learners at any
point in the lesson.</p>

<p>As we have seen, there are many teaching practices that can make your
workshop more positive and welcoming. However, no workshop occurs in a
vacuum: everyone’s experiences begin and end and are influenced by the
world beyond. In this section we will discuss some of the systemic
barriers that can result in members of some groups being excluded even
in an otherwise welcoming environment. The fact that some groups face
barriers that others do not means we cannot take a one size fits all
approach to creating a positive learning environment.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#definitions"></a>
</h3>
<p>This section addresses topics related to equity, inclusion, and
accessibility. These terms are increasingly common and may be familiar
to you, but not everyone understands or interprets them in the same way.
So, we will start with a few working definitions, adapted from the <a href="https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/education/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-glossary" class="external-link">University
of Pittsburgh DEI Glossary</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Equity:</strong> The proportional distribution of desirable
outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers
to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Actively engaging traditionally excluded
individuals and/or groups in processes, activities and decisions in a
way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared
participation, and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe,
positive, and nurturing environments.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Refers to the intentional design or
redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few)
that increase one’s ability to use, access, and obtain the respective
item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same
information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same
services in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with
substantially equivalent ease of use.</p>

<p>In 2019, The Carpentries formed a task force that worked with our
community to identify 9 <a href="https://carpentries.org/values/" class="external-link">Core

<p>In your discussion of accessibility, it is helpful to point out that
accessibility may not alway affect only individual learners, such as
persons with disabilities. Geographic and social differences can present
barriers to accessibility for entire groups. People in rural regions or
institutions with unreliable electicity and internet access, for
example, face extra barriers to participating in online Carpentries
workshops, instructor trainings, and community events.</p>

Issue?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-happens-when-accessibility-is-an-issue"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Think of a time when you have been affected by, or noticed someone
else being affected by barriers to accessibility. This may have been at
a conference you attended where the elevator was out of service, or
maybe a class you were taking relied on audio delivery of content.
Describe what happened, how it impacted your (or someone else’s) ability
to be involved and what could have been done to provide better
accessibility in this case.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While it may not be possible to anticipate all needs, it <em>is</em>
possible to get a good working structure in place without any knowledge
of what specific disabilities people might have. Having some
accommodations prepared also demonstrates care, helping learners to
trust that additional requests are likely to be well received.</p>
<p>If you are playing the host role (or part of it), note that our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/workshop_administration/email_templates.html#email-learners-before-workshop" class="external-link">host
template</a> includes an inquiry regarding accessibility needs. However,
be aware that <strong>many people will not feel comfortable requesting
accommodations in advance</strong>, or at all if it can be avoided. For
example, a participant who is hard of hearing may simply hope that
instructors will speak loudly enough for them to hear. Taking steps to
make your workshop maximally accessible can relieve your participants of
the need to disclose personal information.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="from-accommodation-to-universal-design">From Accommodation to Universal Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-accommodation-to-universal-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>Accommodation means changing things to serve an individual with a
demonstrated need. However, <strong>accommodation puts the onus on the
individual with the need</strong> to have to disclose their disability
and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to do so is understandable:
requests for accommodation are often met with negative emotions such as
uncertainity, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving the
requests.</p>
<p>By contrast, “universal design” means creating something to be
maximally usable by all people without additional changes. A good
example of universal design is curb cuts and sidewalk ramps. While they
were originally created to make it easier for wheelchair users to move
around, they proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and
grocery carts.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST)
brought Universal Design into Education with the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org" class="external-link">Universal Design in Learning (UDL)
Framework</a>. UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the course
designer rather than on the learner. It states that the most inclusive
approach to education is to design instruction with diverse learners in
mind from the beginning.</p>
<p>UDL is not about finding the one, best way to teach everyone. The key
to UDL is creating redundancies such that learners have multiple options
in how they:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>receive</li>
<li>engage, and</li>
<li>share information.</li>

<p>Looking at people who work with disability and accessibility, it’s
easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make
instruction more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>It is ok not to do everything at once.</em> We do not ask
learners in our workshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in
one go, but instead to add things gradually at a rate they can manage.
Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for
workshops through reflective practice, adding something new each
time.</li>
<li>
<em>Do the easy things first.</em> There are plenty of ways to make
workshops more accessible that are both quick to accomplish and minimal
in demands on attention: font choices, text size, checking in advance
that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.</li>

<p>As Instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within
our control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and
there will always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation
and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members
of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that
disproportionately impact them. What we can control, in this case, is
our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to teaching and
learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also think
carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our
learners to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="stereotypes">Stereotypes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive
purpose. <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1566" class="external-link">One
study</a> suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information
every day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our
brains use shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of
those shortcuts. As with other models, they are all wrong… but some are
dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-are-stereotypes">What are stereotypes?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in
which a set of characteristics is associated with members of a group.
Sterotypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious
and automatic)</li>
<li>guide what we notice about people</li>
<li>guide how we interpret people’s behaviors</li>
<li>can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations
(e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)</li>
<li>can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards
members of certain groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are
especially hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people
holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are
guided by them.</p>
<p><strong>When Instructors have stereotypes about learners</strong>,
this may lead them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>call attention to differences unnecessarily</li>
<li>give more or less attention to certain learners</li>
<li>respond to questions differently for certain learners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When learners experience stereotypes about
themselves</strong>, they may:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability</li>
<li>experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a
stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as
<em>stereotype threat</em>.</li>

<p>One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to
sign up for workshops in small teams rather than as individuals when
possible. If an entire lab group comes, or if attendees are drawn from
the same (or closely-related) disciplines, everyone in the room will
know in advance that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
which increases the chances of them actually coming. Furthermore, if
people attend a workshop with their labmates, it’s more likely they will
work together to implement what they’ve learned after the workshop has
ended.</p>

<p>We can monitor our own use of stereotypes, but the experiences that
people have before and after our workshop are beyond our control.
Because these experiences are unequal, including historical and
present-day differences in access to resources, mentorship, and other
avenues towards career success, we aim to make Carpentries programs
<em>equitable</em>. This means that, rather than offering the same
access and experience to all, we aim to use our programs to actively
counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to disproportionate
representation of certain groups in data-centric careers.</p>

reaching out to historically under-represented groups in your community

<p>One central way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html" class="external-link">Code
of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>All participants in our workshops, activities and communities are
required to abide by the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html" class="external-link">Code
of Conduct</a>. This code helps to ensure that our community does not
tolerate the persistence of behaviors that harm or exclude others. While
such a code cannot prevent all incidents, reminding participants of the
Code of Conduct supports them in being mindful of the impact of their
words and actions. It also offers reassurance to all that the
instructional team cares about their experience, creating an environment
that is explicitly inclusive and supports safe focus on learning.</p>
<p>We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail in Part 4 of
this training during our discussion of Working with your team.</p>

<h3 id="listening-with-assessment-and-feedback">Listening with Assessment and Feedback<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#listening-with-assessment-and-feedback"></a>
</h3>
<p>Motivating practices like those discussed in the previous episode to
invite participation and encourage a growth mindset can also contribute
to making a classroom more inclusive for diverse learners. However, we
cannot assume that any instructional approach has succeeded at fostering
inclusion if we do not listen to our audience. Explicitly seeking to
learn from and attend to the concerns of your learners is key. If you
find yourself feeling uncertain about whether you are successfully
including all learners, this is a good time to pause and create an
opportunity to listen.</p>
<p>When you are actively providing avenues for feedback, there are two
signs of trouble to watch out for: negative feedback, and a <strong>lack
of feedback</strong>. If an environment does not feel inclusive, many
learners will not feel comfortable reporting this; indeed, they may not
recognize it themselves. It can be difficult to notice the people you
are <em>not</em> hearing from in a room! When in doubt, communicate with
your team and work together to identify and (gently) check in with
anyone you haven’t heard from. In addition, examine your feedback
processes to be sure you are including opportunities for
<strong>anonymous feedback</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="examining-your-actions">Examining your Actions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#examining-your-actions"></a>
</h3>
<p>When you pay close attention to your own actions, this can help you
to do more than (painfully) identify how often you use the word “just”!
Monitoring your actions can also provide you with useful information
about the ways in which you behave differently with different people.
This is normal! It is also an excellent way to identify patterns that
may intefere with your intent to create an inclusive environment for
all. Did you answer the same question in different ways at different
points? If so, why? Who did you feel comfortable chatting with at break
time, and who seemed harder to connect with? Did you offer help to
anyone who didn’t ask for it? Who were you most eager to impress?</p>
<p>Asking yourself questions like these is hard! Answering them is
harder. When you notice things that trouble you, keep a positive and
simple goal in mind: to learn and to improve.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In the last episode, we discussed the transition from novice to
competent practitioner through formation of a functional mental model.
We now shift our attention to experts. The expert we want to talk about
is you!</p>
<p>Even if you do not yet think of yourself as an expert, you may
nonetheless have advanced to the point where some of these key
characteristics – and potential pitfalls – apply to you. We will discuss
what distinguishes expertise from novices/competent practitioners, how
being an expert can make it more difficult to teach novices, and some
tools to help instructors identify and overcome these difficulties.</p>
</section><section id="what-makes-an-expert"><h2 class="section-heading">What Makes an Expert?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-makes-an-expert"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>An <a href="02-practice-learning/">earlier topic</a> described a key
difference between novices and competent practitioners. Novices lack a
mental model, or have only a very incomplete model with limited utility.
Competent practitioners have mental models that work well enough for
most situations. How are experts different from both of these
groups?</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>What is something that you are an expert in? How does your experience
when you are acting as an expert differ from when you are not an
expert?</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In reviewing the answers to the question above you will find that the
expert experience amounts to much more than just knowing more facts.
Competent practitioners can memorize a lot of information without any
noticeable improvement to their performance. So, what makes an expert?
The answer is that experts have <strong>more connections among pieces of
knowledge</strong> that help them think and problem-solve quickly; more
“short-cuts”, if you will.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/mental_models.svg" alt='Three collections of six circles. The first collection is labelled "Novice" and has only two arrows connecting some of the circles. The second collection, labelled "Competent Practitioner" has six connecting arrows. The third collection, labelled "Expert", is densly connected, with eight connecting arrows.' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>This brings us back to our mental model diagrams, where facts are
nodes and relationships are arcs. The greater connectivity of a mental
model allows experts to:</p>
<ul>
<li>see connections between two topics or ideas that no one else can
see</li>
<li>see a single problem in several different ways</li>
<li>know how to solve a problem, or “what questions to ask”</li>
<li>jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a
direct link between the two in their mind. Where a competent
practitioner would have to reason “A therefore B therefore C therefore
F”, the expert can go from A to F in a single step (“A therefore
F”).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will expand on some of these below and how they can manifest in
the way you teach.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Because your learners’ mental models will likely be less densely
connected than your own, a conclusion that seems obvious to you will not
seem that way to your learners. It is important to explain what you are
doing step-by-step, and how each step leads to the next one.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="mind-the-gap">Mind The Gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#mind-the-gap"></a>
</h3>
<p>The problem with this is that when you are used to going from A to F
in a single leap, it can be very hard to remember that novices need to
go through steps B and C before they can understand the connection
between A and F. Experts are frequently so familiar with their subject
that they can no longer imagine what it is like to <em>not</em>
understand the world that way. This phenomenon is known in the
literature as an <em>expert blind spot</em>.</p>

<h3 class="callout-title">Expert Awareness Gap<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expert-awareness-gap"></a>
</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>In The Carpentries, we aim to create an inclusive environment. We
prefer to refer to this phenomenon as the <em>expert awareness gap</em>
to be consistent with our objective to use inclusive language. It can be
exclusionary to use a term that relates to a disability for other
purposes. We introduce both terms, however, to help you as future
instructors engage with these ideas in the literature and with people
outside of The Carpentries community.</p>
<p>In evaluating potential terms, one instructor provided the following
thoughts:</p>
<p>I like expert awareness gap because it is more precise than blind
spot (it is not about seeing, but about noticing) and feels more of a
surmountable challenge than a disadvantage. To me a disadvantage can
sometimes feel like a thing that exists as a fact, like an inevitable
consequence, but a gap is a thing to be bridged– and we certainly want
instructors to try to overcome (or mitigate) their expert awareness
gap</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Awareness gaps can lead to some interesting reversals in the
classroom. While deep expertise in a subject area can be valuable when
teaching, it can also create obstacles that must be overcome with
practice. People with less expertise, who still remember what it is like
to have to learn the things, can be better equipped to anticipate novice
misconceptions compared with an expert who has not learned to identify
their awareness gaps.</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? If you have deep expertise in the
subject you are hoping to teach, listen carefully to your learners, and
seek out less-expert colleagues to discuss your teaching plans. If, on
the other hand, you still feel new to your subject area – perhaps you
even feel a little tentative about whether you are “expert enough” to
teach – take heart! Your explanations may be more likely to meet novice
learners where they are.</p>

<h3 id="switching-language">Switching Language<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#switching-language"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you worked in the USA in the same building as something called a
“delicatessen”, you might invite a friend to meet you at “the deli” or
simply at “the restaurant” and expect them to know what you mean,
because you naturally use these terms interchangeably. Yet, someone less
familiar with US English might hesitate, wondering if these words mean
the same thing, or close enough, under the circumstances. Similarly, in
a Carpentries workshop, an Instructor may start a workshop talking about
“Unix”, but then automatically start using words like “Bash” and “shell”
without noticing that learners are struggling to figure out how these
two new words are related.</p>
<p>Novice learners can be confused by interchangeable use of more than
just vocabulary. In programming, multiple forms of notation may be used
to reference a column in a data frame, for example, with the same
effect. Instructors may use absolute file paths in one place, then
default to relative file paths elsewhere without noticing that
explanation is required. Or, they may assume that a learner who has an
absolute file path will be able to navigate to the file in a GUI.</p>

<p>Experts are also better at diagnosing errors than novices or
competent practitioners. If faced with an error message while teaching,
an expert will often automatically diagnose and solve a problem before a
novice has even finished reading the error message. Because of this, it
is very important while teaching to be explicit about the process you
are using to engage with errors, even if they seem trivial to you, as
they often will.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Instructors want to motivate learners! We will talk more about
motivation in a later episode. But here, we will take a moment to
recognize one <em>ineffective</em> strategy often deployed by experts
who want learners to <em>believe that a task is as easy as they think it
is.</em> This often manifests in using the word “just” in explanations,
as in, “Look, it is easy, you just… (<em>wave magic wand with
undecipherable incantations</em>)” This language gives learners the very
clear signal that the person helping them thinks their problem is
trivial and that there must be something wrong with them if they do not
experience it that way.</p>
<p>With practice, we can change the way we speak to avoid dismissive
language and replace it with more positive and motivating word
choices.</p>

<li>“We only need to learn two new commands to accomplish the next

<p>Another well-intended move that can go wrong in the presence of
awareness gaps is the call for questions. An Instructor may accidentally
dismiss learner confusion by asking for questions in a way that reveals
that <em>they do not actually expect that anyone will have them</em>.
Asking, “Does anyone have any questions?” implies that most people will
not; the shorter the wait time before moving on, the more this
implication is magnified. Instead, consider asking “What questions do
you have?” and leaving a healthy pause for consideration. This firmly
establishes an expectation that people will, indeed, have questions, and
should challenge themselves to formulate them.</p>

<p>As you seek to re-acquaint yourself with the novice experience, it
can be tempting to think back to your own experiences getting started in
programming. Trips down memory lane can be productive! However, it is
important that you take care not to generalize from your experience to
that of your novice learners.</p>
<p>We will talk more about knowing your audience in a later episode. For
now, here are two points to keep in mind when contemplating the learner
experience</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases a researcher’s <strong>primary goal is not to learn
programming</strong>, but to do better and more efficient research. They
may not wish to take the time to learn how fundamental syntax or data
structures work, or to learn any ‘fun facts’ that are not strictly
necessary; they just want to know how to get their work done. This does
not mean they never will be interested – maybe this is how you got your
start, too! But if you began with an interest in programming, keep in
mind that this can make their learning experience very different from
yours.</li>
<li>Some researchers have avoided learning programming previously
because they believe that the time investment will be excessive and will
interfere with their other work. These kinds of beliefs can make their
motivation to persevere more fragile than yours might have been when you
got started.</li>

meaningful connections, to confidently turn an error into a learning
opportunity, or to explain a complex topic in multiple ways. Experts can
be highly effective as long as they <strong>learn to identify and

power to bring these problems to the surface. As you develop teaching
skill, you may be able to avoid these pitfalls. Until then, becoming

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Teaching and learning are not the same process. As we have seen, an
instructor can make choices that facilitate the cognitive processes
necessary for learning to occur. But <strong>any technique can fall flat
when learners are not motivated</strong>. Worse, demotivation is
contagious! Teaching or sharing a classroom with demotivated learners is
not fun or rewarding. It can be tempting, especially for teachers facing
burnout after strenuous and ineffectual effort, to blame learners for
spoiling the classroom experience.</p>
<p>It is true that learner motivation is influenced by many factors well
beyond the control of an instructor, including individual background and
systemic forces. However, there are many things you can do to cultivate
motivation in your classroom, and perhaps most importantly, to
<strong>avoid doing harm</strong> to the precious drive your learners
bring to the classroom on day one. In Carpentries workshops, most
learners come eager to learn! You have the power to influence how they
feel when they depart.</p>
<p>No two-day workshop can truly bring a total novice to the level of a
competent practitioner. Carpentries workshops function in a context of
<em>self training</em>, in which workshops offer vital tools and a map
for learners to proceed on their own. Our workshops lower the barrier to
entry and help learners to get off on the right foot. In this context,
<strong>cultivating motivation to continue learning, and to carefully
pursue best-practices in doing so, is arguably the most important
outcome we can achieve</strong>.</p>
<p>This section discusses several ways that learners can be motivated
(or demotivated!) by instructional content and approaches, and provides
practice opportunities for you to become confident in motivating your
learners.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>People learn best when they care about a topic and believe they can
master it with a reasonable investment of time and effort. Many
scientists might appreciate the value of programming but believe that
developing useful skills will take more time than they have available.
This presents a problem because <strong>believing that something will be
too hard to learn often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to combat this problem is to begin a lesson with something
that is <strong>quick to learn and immediately useful</strong>. It is
particularly important that <em>learners</em> see it as useful in their
daily work. This not only motivates them, it also helps build their
confidence in us, so that if it takes longer to get to something they
find useful in a later topic, they will persist with the lesson.</p>
<p>Imagine a graph whose axes are labelled “mean time to master” and
“usefulness once mastered”. Tasks that are quick to master and
immediately useful should ideally be taught first; things in the
opposite corner that are time-consuming to learn and have little
near-term application should be avoided in our workshops.</p>

tasks</strong> – real tasks performed by someone doing their work. If
you can identify authentic tasks from your own work that could be useful
to others, these examples will be highly motivating.</p>

“low/high usefulness”. In the class Etherpad, <strong>share</strong> the
task and where it fits on the graph. As a group, we will discuss how
these relate back to our “teach most immediately useful first”
approach.</p>

<p>Any useful estimate of time must take into account <strong>how
frequent failures are</strong> and how much time is lost to them. For
example, editing a text file seems like a quick task, but most graphical
editors save things to the user’s desktop or home directory. If a novice
needs to run shell commands on the files they’ve edited, they often fail
to navigate to the right directory without help. You will learn to
anticipate these sorts of challenges as you chart your <a href="04-expertise.html#expertise-and-teaching">expert awareness
gaps</a>. As a result, your skill at estimating time to mastery will
improve. If you are new to teaching, try to ask an experienced
instructor for feedback before trying out a new exercise.</p>

<p>While we aim to begin workshops with motivating content, in practice
this does not always occur. Workflow-based content like that taught in
Data Carpentry workshops may start at the beginning of the workflow, for
example. Even when a ‘motivating example’ is built in to the start of a
workshop, technical problems like software installation can turn those
precious first minutes into an experience of frustration and impatience.
That is ok! What is important is to <strong>be mindful of times when
your content is not motivating</strong>, and to strategize ways to
re-engage learners (and yourself) using some of the other techniques in
this section.</p>

<h3 id="invite-participation">Invite Participation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#invite-participation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Motivation is supported by active engagement. Participation allows
learners to ask questions, resolving roadblocks quickly, and demonstrate
knowledge, building confidence. It also facilitates learning! However,
in a room full of strangers, <strong>most learners will not immediately
feel comfortable speaking up</strong>, especially when they feel
confusion or doubt. Creating a motivating classroom means inviting
communication and reinforcing that invitation with an attentive
response.</p>
<p>A few ways to invite participation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Establishing norms for interaction</strong>. This can be
done by creating procedures for communication, e.g. turn taking in
discussions, passing around a ‘talking stick’, or encouraging quieter
people to contribute. Having, discussing, and enforcing a <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html" class="external-link">Code
of Conduct</a> also provides a framework for positive communication to
occur.</li>
<li>
<strong>Encouraging learners to learn from each other</strong>.
Working in pairs, or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming" class="external-link">pair
programming</a>,” encourages learners to talk through their learning
process, reinforcing memory and making it more likely that confusion
will be expressed and resolved. This can also address challenges of
varying background experience: asking more advanced learners to help
beginners can maximize learning for both. In these cases, make sure the
beginner is doing the typing!</li>
<li>
<strong>Acknowledging when learners are confused</strong>.
Acknowledging and exploring confusion with kindness rewards learners for
sharing vulnerable information. It also helps you examine your expert
awareness gaps! Formative assessments can pinpoint misunderstandings.
When learners see that others are confused, they are more likely to
share their own uncertainties.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="encourage-a-growth-mindset">Encourage a Growth Mindset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#encourage-a-growth-mindset"></a>
</h3>
<p>People vary in their beliefs about the nature of intelligence and
skill development. In academic environments, people are often praised as
“talented” or having “high ability,” and may develop an identity around
being a certain “type of person” who has inherent strengths or
weaknesses.</p>
<p>The belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made –
dubbed a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> by Carol Dweck – may impact the
learning process. Broadly, this is a continuing topic of research and
debate in education communities. In the specific context of Carpentries
workshops, we frequently encounter learners who believe that they are
not “computational people,” and Instructors often report that this fixed
mindset interferes with motivation to engage fully with the task of
learning to program. We therefore recommend three types of interventions
that have been shown to influence mindset, encouraging learners to
believe that ability can be acquired through effort – a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Positive error framing</strong>. Errors are inevitable when
learning a new skill. However, learners will often interpret errors as
indicators of inability – adopting a fixed mindset. Encouraging learners
to understand errors in a positive way – as an opportunity to learn
something they would have missed otherwise – reinforces a growth mindset
and helps them to stay motivated. Be sure to discuss this with your
helpers, since they are often the ‘first responders’ to learner
mistakes.</li>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>A learner at your workshop asks for your help with an exercise and
shows you their attempt at solving it. You see they’ve made an error
that shows they misunderstand something fundamental about the lesson
(for example, in the shell lesson, they forgot to put a space between
<code>ls</code> and the name of the directory they are looking at). What
would you say to the learner?</p>
<p>In the Etherpad, describe the error your learner has made and how you
would respond.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Presenting the instructor as a learner</strong>. We want our
learners to have confidence in our qualifications, but it is easy to
take this too far. Presenting yourself as a learner offers a relatable
model, fostering a growth mindset and teaching a positive approach to
the continuing challenge of learning. Using <a href="17-live">participatory live coding</a>, our chosen method for
teaching concepts, is very useful for this reason. It is common to make
errors while coding. Embrace these with enthusiasm! Leveraging your own
mistakes as opportunities can turn an awkward moment into a highlight of
a lesson, demonstrating both problem-solving approaches and positive
error framing. If you are unlucky and fail to make any useful mistakes,
sharing stories about your learning process can help here, too.</li>

<li>
<strong>Praising effort or improvement, not performance or
ability</strong>. Praise based on the quality of performance often feels
like the highest praise because it goes straight to your identity as a
person of intellect and skill. When faced with a fixed mindset (“I’m not
a computational person!”), many well-intentioned teachers counter with
another fixed mindset (“You ARE a computational person! You’re really
good at this!”). However, this doesn’t prepare learners to interpret
future obstacles as irrelevant to innate ability. Evidence suggests that
learner perseverance is best supported in the long term by praising
effort or improvement instead. If you are not convinced of this,
consider the impact on the person sitting next to your target, who might
overhear but not receive the same praise.</li>

sentences helps emphasize that being a novice is a temporary state, and
encourages a growth mindset towards progress.</li>

<h3 id="first-do-no-harm">First, Do No Harm!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#first-do-no-harm"></a>
</h3>
<p>When learning a skill, we develop more than expert awareness gaps –
we also develop Opinions about tools and methods, and sometimes base a
professional identity around displaying technical expertise. Technical
boasts, insults, and other showy moves can score points in conversation
with fellow experts, but these present serious hazards in the classroom!
Here are a few <strong>things you should not do in your
workshop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool or
practice</strong>, or the people who use them. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool, and may have
invested many years in learning to do so. Convincing someone to change
their practices is much harder when they think you disdain them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion</strong>
with the one or two people in the audience who clearly don’t actually
need to be there. Reserve those conversations for breaks or follow-up
emails.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pretend to know more than you do</strong>. People will
actually trust you more if you are frank about the limitations of your
knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help. (Also
see “Presenting the instructor as a learner,” above)</li>
<li>
<strong>Use the J word (“just”) or other demotivating words</strong>
we talked about in a <a href="04-expertise.html">previous lesson</a>.
These signal to the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is
trivial and by extension that they therefore must be deficient if they
are not able to figure it out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Take over the learner’s keyboard</strong>. It is rarely a
good idea to type anything for your learners. Doing so can be
demotivating for the learner (as it implies you don’t think they can do
it themselves or that you don’t want to wait for them). It also wastes a
valuable opportunity for your learner to develop muscle memory and other
skills that are essential for independent work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Express surprise at unawareness</strong>. Saying things like
“I can’t believe you don’t know X” or “You’ve never heard of Y?” signals
to the learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the
material you are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and
it may prevent them from asking questions in the future. (For more on
this see the Recurse Center’s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment" class="external-link">Social
Rules</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be difficult to avoid these demotivators entirely. Some people
are so used to complaining about certain tools that they initially fail
to realize they’re doing it while teaching. If you catch yourself doing
this, you might find a way to walk it back, or consider how you might
repair or improve your motivational efforts on your next interaction.
Teaching yourself – and your helpers! – to avoid these types of comments
takes practice, but is well worth the effort.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Carpentries learners fill out a survey before attending and
immediately after a workshop. These surveys include questions to help
instructors get an idea of their attendees’ prior experience and
backgrounds before the workshop starts. Using this information,
instructors can start to plan how they will approach the materials and
what level of exercises are likely to be appropriate for their
learners.</p>

<p>We have found that learners are much more likely to fill out the
post-workshop survey while they are still at the workshop than they are
after they leave the venue. At the end of a multi-day workshop, your
learners’ brains will be very tired. Rather than trying to fit in
another 15 minutes worth of teaching, give your learners time to
complete the post-workshop survey at the end of your workshop. You will
be helping them (with an opportunity to reflect), yourself (you will get
more useful feedback), and The Carpentries (we improve our programs
based on feedback, and our funders take pride in the success of our
workshops, too).</p>
</div>
</section><section id="minute-cards"><h2 class="section-heading">Minute Cards<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#minute-cards"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before each long break, for example lunch or between days, we have
learners complete <strong>minute cards</strong> to share anonymous
feedback. At an in-person workshop, paper sticky notes double as minute
cards, with the two different colors used for positive and constructive
feedback. At an online workshop, this may be done by making a copy of
our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview" class="external-link">Virtual
Minute Card Template</a> on Google Forms. Other tools can work as well,
but we do recommend making sure that feedback is private and anonymous.
A public-facing sticky note board will receive different (and less
useful) feedback.</p>
<p>Whatever method you use, you may wish to customize the prompt to
elicit different types of feedback at each break.</p>
<p><strong>Example positive prompts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One thing you liked about this section of the workshop</li>
<li>The most important thing you learned today</li>
<li>A new skill, command, or technique you are most excited about
using</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example constructive prompts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One thing you did not like or would change about this section of the
workshop</li>
<li>One thing that is confusing / you would like clarification on.</li>
<li>One question you have</li>
</ul>
<p>During long breaks, instructors read through the minute cards and
look for patterns. At the start of each half day, the Instructors take a
few minutes to address commonly raised issues with the whole class. The
non-teaching Instructor can also type answers to the questions in the
Etherpad.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Learners are more likely to give useful feedback if they feel that
their feedback is being taken seriously. Spending a few minutes talking
about the feedback you got and being explicit about what changes you are
making in light of that feedback will encourage learners to continue to
give informative feedback throughout the workshop.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>In addition to minute cards, we also ask learners to give us feedback
at the end of each day using a technique called “one up, one down”. The
instructor asks the learners to alternately give one positive and one
negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has
already been said. This requirement forces people to say things they
otherwise might not: once all the “safe” feedback has been given,
participants will start saying what they really think. The instructor
writes down the feedback in the Etherpad or a text editor, but does not
comment on the feedback while collecting it. The instructors then
discuss this feedback and how they plan to act on it. Like with minute
cards, be explicit about how you are responding to learner feedback.</p>

Instructor Training</p>
<p>One of the cornerstones of The Carpentries teaching is live coding:
<em>instructors do not use slides to teach coding</em>, but work through
the lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with the
workshop participants following along. This section explains how it
works, why we use it, and gives general tips for an effective
participatory live coding presentation. We will finish this section by
practicing ourselves and providing feedback for each other.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We do not use slides in our lessons. Instead, instructors plug their
laptop into the projector and work through the lesson, typing in the
code, reformatting data, and talking as we go. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding" class="external-link">“live coding”</a>.
However, the instructor is not live coding in a vacuum. Importantly,
learners are strongly encouraged to “code-along” with the instructor. We
refer to the practice of having the instructor live code and the
learners code along as “participatory live coding” or, less formally,
‘code-along sessions’.</p>

both a learner’s and an instructor’s point of view in the Etherpad.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Some advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
code.</li>
<li>It enables instructors to be more responsive to “what if?”
questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, participatory
live coding allows instructors to go off-road and follow their learners’
interests.</li>
<li>Lateral knowledge transfer: participatory live coding facilitates
the transfer of <a href="https://jonudell.net/udell/2006-09-19-screencasting-of-tacit-knowledge.html" class="external-link">tacit
knowledge</a> – people learn more than we realized we were teaching by
watching <em>how</em> instructors do things.</li>
<li>It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners, rather
than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</li>
<li>Learners get to see instructors’ mistakes <em>and how to diagnose
and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time
doing this, but it is left out of most textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires instructors to be able to improvise when things go wrong
or when learners have questions not directly addressed in the text of
the lesson.</li>
<li>It can be hard for learners to listen and type at the same time, due
to the<br><em>split-attention effect</em> we <a href="05-memory.html#why-guided-practice-is-important">discussed
earlier</a>. This is why it is very important that instructors first
explain what they are going to do, then say what they are typing as they
type it, and then explain what they did again afterwards.</li>
<li>It may take a bit of practice for instructors to get used to
thinking aloud while coding in front of an audience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Live coding fits well into the practice-feedback model we have been
discussing - by providing learners with continuous opportunities for
practice (every time they type in a line of code) and continuous
feedback (their code either works or fails with an error message). It is
important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not helpful if you
cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not written
with novices in mind. Continue to use the strategies for error framing
that <a href="08-motivation.html">we learned earlier</a> to make sure
this feedback is useful to learners.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Debugging as a skill</strong> – while learners may have
negative associations with “mistakes” or “typos”, it may be useful to
re-frame troubleshooting as the routine process of finding and fixing
“bugs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to parse error messages is an important step in
developing debugging skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intentional vs accidental errors</strong> - It can be
useful to intentionally demonstrate common mistakes and error messages.
Alternatively, mistakes made by the Instructor or learners can offer
useful opportunities to learn about and positively frame
errors.</p></li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Stand up and move around the room if possible.</strong> This
makes the experience more interactive and less monotonous. Use a
microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing
difficulties to hear you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Go slowly.</strong> For every command you type, every word
of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out
loud what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and
its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This slows you
down and allows learners to copy what you do, or to catch up. Do not
copy-paste code.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mirror your learners’ environment.</strong> Try to create an
environment that is as similar as possible to what your learners have to
reduce cognitive load. Avoid using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use your screen wisely.</strong> Use a big font, and
maximize the window. A black font on a white background works better
than a light font on a dark background. When the bottom of the projector
screen is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners,
people in the back will not be able to see the lower parts. Draw up the
bottom of your window(s) to compensate. Pay attention to the lighting
(not too dark, no lights directly on/above the presenter’s screen) and
if needed, re-position the tables so all learners can see the screen,
and helpers can easily reach all learners.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use illustrations</strong> to help learners understand and
organize the material. You can also generate the illustrations on the
board as you progress through the material. This allows you to build up
diagrams, making them increasingly complex in parallel with the material
you are teaching. It helps learners understand the material, makes for a
more lively workshop and gathers the learners’ attention to you as
well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Turn off notifications</strong> on your laptop and
phone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stick to the lesson material.</strong> The core Carpentries
lessons are developed collaboratively by many instructors and tried and
tested at many workshops. This means they are very streamlined - which
is great when you start teaching them for the first time. It may be
tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a
neat trick, or demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Do
not do this, since there is a fair chance you will run into something
unexpected that you then have to explain. If you really want to use
something outside of the material, try it out thoroughly before the
workshop: run through the lesson as you would during the actual teaching
and test the effect of your modification. Some instructors use printouts
of the lesson material during teaching. Others use a second device
(tablet or laptop) when teaching, on which they can view their notes and
the Etherpad session. This seems to be more reliable than displaying one
virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leave no learner behind.</strong> You will learn later in
the training <a href="21-management.html#sticky-notes">how sticky notes
can be used to gauge learners’ progress and understanding</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Embrace mistakes.</strong> No matter how well prepared you
are, you will make mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do
<a href="08-motivation.html">error framing</a> and to help your learners
learn the art of troubleshooting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Have fun!</strong> It is OK to use humor and improvisation
to liven up the workshop. This becomes easier when you are more familiar
with the material, and more relaxed. Start small, even just saying ‘that
was fun’ after something worked well is a good start.</li>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session,
including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver
it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce
yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help
learners</li>
<li>setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the
lesson</li>
<li>segments of teaching and exercises from the lesson and any other
planned activities (e.g. group discussions, wrap-up and feedback)</li>
<li>checkpoints - places where you have planned to stop to check-in with
learners</li>
<li>slides, figures and other visual aids needed to deliver teaching and
other parts of the teaching plan</li>

<p>Checkpoints are especially useful at the beginning of a lesson when
you may not have as many exercises but the learners need to have the
data downloaded or tool opened to be able to follow along. A checkpoint
could include stopping to ask what questions learners have or having
them indicate if they have completed the most recent step shown by the
instructor.</p>

<p>Figures and other visual aids are great tools to help participants
understand the content being presented and make associations between
pieces of information. The Instructor View of the lesson website
includes a link in the top menu to <em>Extract All Images</em>,
providing a single page containing all of the images in the lesson and
their captions: this can be useful as an alternative to a slide deck
when refering to figures and other visual aids during a workshop.</p>
<p>If your lesson requires participants to use any software, tools or
data - it is worthwhile investing time now into creating clear download,
installation and setup instructions for participants to follow and
circulating them ahead of the workshop. This will give you more time at
the pilot for teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems on
the spot can be time-consuming and stressful. Each Carpentries lesson
has a dedicated place for setup instructions within The Carpentries
Workbench located in the file <code>learners/setup.md</code> off the
lesson project root.</p>

<p>Another standard piece of The Carpentries Workbench are the
<em>Instructor Notes</em> pages - intended to help you and other
instructors deliver your lesson by providing useful tips for how to best
run a workshop or explain “sticky” points in the lesson. Instructor
Notes for your lesson are located in the
<code>instructors/instructor-notes.md</code> file off your lesson
project root where you may consider adding the following
information:</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale, strengths and/or weaknesses of the lesson design</li>
<li>what has been tried before and what worked/did not work</li>
<li>tips for teaching the lesson/particular episodes</li>
<li>challenges encountered</li>
<li>troubleshooting common setup/installation/exercise issues</li>
<li>parts that seem to cause trouble or most confusion for learners
(i.e. where to tread carefully, spend more time explaining)</li>

<p>It may initially be difficult to create Instructor Notes until you
have taught the lesson yourself for the first time - but after the first

<p>The concept of <strong>hidden curriculum</strong> describes
curricular effects that influence learning but are not explicitly
addressed in the lesson content - e.g. (unofficial) social and cultural
norms, behaviours and values that are transferred by instructors to
learners, often unconsciously. These are all the additional things that
people learn about the topic from <em>the way</em> your lesson is
taught, rather than from its official content. It is worthwhile to spend
some time thinking about what learners could pick up from <em>the
way</em> your lesson is taught, as well as from its written content. You
can use Instructor Notes to guide instructors on some of the aspects of
the hidden curriculum of your lesson, e.g. to encourage them to follow
certain tried and tested practices.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and
this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can
be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching,
hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the
feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you
are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants
you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you
refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus
their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you
should be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>constantly and throughout the workshop</strong>
<ul>
<li>As notes taken by an observer/co-instructor - refer to the <a href="operations.html#pilot-workshops">“Pilot Workshops” episode</a> for
suggestions on things to track and the [pilot workshop notes
template][pilot-notes-template] and other suggested feedback collection
mechanisms to help you gather such information.</li>
<li>As “minute card” feedback from learners - minute cards are short
comments from learners on what is working well and what could be
improved, provided frequently (e.g. at the end of each session). Like
exercises used as formative assessment, minute card feedback can be
provided by learners while there is still time for instructors to act on
it and adjust their approach. You may find <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview" class="external-link">the
Virtual Minute Card template</a> helpful for workshops run online, and
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback.html#minute-cards" class="external-link">the
Instructor Training curriculum describes how sticky notes can be used at
in-person events</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>at a designated wrap-up and feedback session at the end of
the workshop.</strong> Here, you can cover any other feedback that was
not addressed up to that point and any specific questions you may want
to ask your audience (e.g. about the choice of topics for the lesson,
difficulty level, workshop operations). You may design a special form
that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview" class="external-link">post-workshop
survey template</a> for workshops that pilot a lesson in The Carpentries
Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey
to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you
can supplement it with additional questions.</li>

<p>The final part of this training will focus on the skills needed to
collaborate effectively. Before that there will be a break, during which
we would like you to complete the following three tasks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Teach one episode of your lesson (probably the one you have been
working on in these two days). See the <a href="trial-runs.html">Lesson
Trial Runs</a> page for full details.</li>
<li>After your trial run has concluded (immediately after, or when you
have reviewed any feedback you collected from learners), note down your
answers to the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What worked?</li>
<li>What did not?</li>
<li>What will you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What will you change in your material you taught? We will refer to
these notes when we reconvene for the last episode of this
training.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Based on your experience teaching the material and the feedback you
received from your learners and helpers, make a list of issues you have
identified with the material you prepared, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>examples that did not work as expected,</li>
<li>improvements that could be made to exercises,</li>
<li>parts that learners found particularly challenging,</li>
<li>unexpected questions or misconceptions that came up during the trial
run.</li>
</ul>
We will return to these notes during the final training session, so
please make sure you save them somewhere you will be able to find them
again easily when the time comes.</li>

<p>The homework from this workshop includes a trial run of one of the
episodes you have been developing in your lesson, to a real
audience.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="trial-runs.html">the information provided
about the trial run task</a> and thinking about this task, what
questions do you have about how you should approach teaching that trial
run? Is there anything you are unsure of? What resources might help you
prepare for that experience?</p>

<li>Spending time on preparing your teaching and feedback collection
will make you and your participants get the most out of your workshop
pilot.</li>
<li>Creating clear setup instructions as part of your lesson and
circulating them ahead of the pilot is time well-invested and will give
you more time when teaching the lesson.</li>
<li>Instructor Notes are teaching tips that you should include with your
lesson to help you (a few months down the line) and other instructors,
who have the relevant topic knowledge but have not been involved in the
lesson design and development, deliver your lesson more
successfully.</li>

    2022-11-07: we have gotten a notification that we have an overage for our
    tracking and I'm pretty sure this has to do with Workbench usage.
    Considering that I am not _currently_ using this tracking because I do not
    yet know how to access the data, I am turning this off for now.
  <script>
    var _paq = window._paq = window._paq || [];
    /* tracker methods like "setCustomDimension" should be called before "trackPageView" */
    _paq.push(["setDocumentTitle", document.domain + "/" + document.title]);
    _paq.push(["setDomains", ["*.preview.carpentries.org","*.datacarpentry.github.io","*.datacarpentry.org","*.librarycarpentry.github.io","*.librarycarpentry.org","*.swcarpentry.github.io", "*.carpentries.github.io"]]);
    _paq.push(["setDoNotTrack", true]);
    _paq.push(["disableCookies"]);
    _paq.push(['trackPageView']);
    _paq.push(['enableLinkTracking']);
    (function() {
          var u="https://carpentries.matomo.cloud/";
          _paq.push(['setTrackerUrl', u+'matomo.php']);
          _paq.push(['setSiteId', '1']);
          var d=document, g=d.createElement('script'), s=d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
