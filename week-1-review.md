::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

After completing this episode, participants should be able to...

- Identify some actions that can be taken to build a strong foundation for a lesson.
- Identify valuable topics from the Carpentries lessons that will *not* be covered in this workshop

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions

- What have we learned so far?
- What are opportunities for continued growth beyond this week?

Menti question 1: what is one skill or piece of knowledge you remember learning last week? 

Question 2: What is one educational skill or strategy you need to feel ready to teach on Thursday?

::::::::::::


Last week, we focused on good practices for designing a lesson,
and provided opportunities to implement these practices. We included theoretical topics such as theories of pedagogy and mental models, but focused on practical strategies for effective teaching. Following the principles of backward design, we learned how to identify a target audience and their prerequisite knowledge, define course objectives, and design formative assessments. 

This week, we will introduce a few new concepts you will need, with an emphasis on preparing you for the lessons you will teach at the end of the week. We'll start by talking about **time management** and **lesson planning**. Next, we'll discuss **tech setup** and **lesson content creation**. Finally, we'll think about **equity, inclusion, and accessibility** before moving on to **live coding** and **the physical act of teaching**. Any remaining time will be spent preparing for your live coding lessons. 

We will spend all day Thursday on the live coding presentations, with room for overflow into Friday. For the rest of the day on Friday, we will review and reflect on the experience of teaching and how to continue refining lessons in the future.

Due to our time constraints, we will not been able to review the full range of teaching resources that the Carpentries have to offer. If you're interested in continuing to build your teaching skillset, we strongly recommend that you explore the following resources:

- the [Carpentries Instructor Training][instructor-training] gives more detail about theories of instruction, memory and cognitive load, what motivates and demotivates learners, and how to get involved in Carpentries culture.
- the [Carpentries Lesson Development Training][lesson-dev] goes into more detail about backward design and each specific step of creating and evaluating a curriculum. We have covered quite a lot of this training, but not all of it. In particular, we have omitted the details about how to create a Carpentries course website like the one you're reading now.
- once you've reviewed the basics of Carpentries website setup in the Lesson Development Training, you can head over to the [Carpentries Workbench][carpentries-workbench] and [Workbench Tutorial][sandpaper-docs] for more technical details on how to spin up your site.


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- So far, we have learned about the importance of defining a target audience and objectives for a lesson, how assessments can be designed to provide specific feedback about learner progress, and the theory of pedagogy.
- This week we will learn the remaining skills for lesson development.
- The Carpentries has many teaching resources you can explore on your own.
