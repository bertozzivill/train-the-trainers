## Discussion: Art Project

Imagine that one day, a child draws a picture of a tree. He shows it to his older sister, his mother, and his aunt.

His older sister says, "That's a terrible drawing, you're bad at art."

His mother says, "That drawing is perfect!! You're an amazing artist!"

His aunt says, "This is so good! I love the details around the leaves. I bet it would look beautiful next time if you tried putting some darker shading behind the trunk."

How do you think the child felt after receiving each of these three pieces of feedback?

## How We View Ourselves Affects How We Learn

The exercise above showed people giving three different types of feedback. The sister gave harsh negative feedback, claiming that the child was categorically bad at art. The mother gave gushing positive feedback, claiming that the child was categorically good at art. The aunt gave some positive feedback, while also gently suggesting ways that the child might improve in the future. 

The child's mother and sister were both demonstrating what psychologist Carol Dweck calls a **fixed mindset**. This is the belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made. The child's aunt, on the other hand, was demonstrating the belief that ability can be acquired through effort-- a **growth mindset**. Especially when learning something that feels complex or intimidating, a fixed mindset can interfere with motivation and growth in a number of ways, as laid out in this diagram:

It's important for you to try and encourage a growth mindset in your learners, and the best way to do so is to embody a growth mindset yourself. Let's go through a few common challenges instructors encounter and consider how we might bring a growth mindset to them.

## Exercise: Teaching Troubles

How might someone with a fixed mindset respond to each of these common challenges? What about someone with a growth mindset?

- A learner asks you a question you don't know the answer to.
- You're doing a live coding demonstration, and your code throws an error when you didn't expect it to.
- You're helping someone write a few lines of code, but they're a slow typer. It would be faster if you took their computer and did it yourself as they watched.
- A student is feeling frustrated and tells you, "I'm just no good at coding!".

We'll go into more detail about how to cultivate a growth mindset in the classroom next week. But for now, let's spend a little time cultivating a growth mindset in ourselves by practicing giving and receiving feedback.
