Welcome to our workshop! We're so glad you're here.

As you advance in your scientific careers, one of your responsibilities will be to pass your skills and knowledge on to others. You could do this in a formal academic setting, a semi-formal workshop like the one we're in now, or via one-on-one instruction. In any setting, there are a series of principles and techniques that will help you teach in a way that others find effective and engaging. 

This two-week training session is designed to help you learn these principles and techniques. Our nine days together will involve a mix of lectures, discussion, small group work, and teaching practice.   


## Logistics

We will meet every day from April 29th to May 10th excluding the holiday
on May 1st. Class will run from 9am to 1pm every day. We will meet at
dLab Kilimanjaro Room, block D. Participants not in Dar should also be
able to join remotely.

### Group Work for Live Coding

Over the course of this workshop, you will collaborate with your peers in small groups to develop a short lesson from start to finish. Over the last two days of the session, groups will lead the class through their short lesson and receive feedback. This session will have a mix of R and Python coders, so you will actually be teaching people something new!

Take some time today or tomorrow to create a group of three people. Make sure all of your are familiar with the same programming language (R or Python). Begin to think about something you really enjoy about your programming language that you might like to share with others. Whatever it is, it must be *small*! Examples include:

- how to make a specific type of plot (line, scatter, bar, etc)
- how to customize the color scheme of a plot
- how to convert from one date-time type to another
- how a single function can help solve a common data cleaning problem

In the coming days, you and your group will decide on a specific thing you'd like to teach and begin building your curriculum from there.

### Code of Conduct


## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

-   teach with a growth mindset, and encourage a growth mindset in
    students;
-   comfortably lead live coding sessions;
-   design lessons and assessments using the principles of backward
    design.


## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should:

-   have the latest versions of [R and
    RStudio](https://bertozzivill.github.io/r-install-instructions)
    installed (see below).
-   have some familiarity with programming in Python or R, especially making plots in either language.
