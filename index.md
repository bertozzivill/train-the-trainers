Welcome to our workshop! We're so glad you're here.

As you advance in your scientific careers, one of your responsibilities
will be to pass your skills and knowledge on to others. You could do
this in a formal academic setting, a semi-formal workshop like the one
we're in now, or via one-on-one instruction. In any setting, there are a
series of principles and techniques that will help you teach in a way
that others find effective and engaging.

This two-week training session is designed to help you learn these
principles and techniques. Our nine days together will involve a mix of
lectures, discussion, small group work, and teaching practice.

## Logistics

We will meet every day from April 29th to May 10th excluding the holiday
on May 1st. Class will run from 9am to 1pm every day. We will meet at
dLab Kilimanjaro Room, block D. Participants not in Dar should also be
able to join remotely.

### Group Work for Live Coding

Over the course of this workshop, you will collaborate with your peers
in small groups to develop a short lesson from start to finish. This
incudes how to identify your target audience, determine what content to
teach, and create an assessment-based curriculum for that content.
Because much of our work involves programming, you will also learn how
to effectively teach using the live coding method. Over the last two
days of the session, groups will lead the class through their short
lesson and receive feedback. This session will have a mix of R and
Python coders, so you will actually be teaching people something new!

Take some time today or tomorrow to create a group of three people. Make
sure all of your are familiar with the same programming language (R or
Python). Begin to think about something you really enjoy about your
programming language that you might like to share with others. Whatever
it is, it must be *small*! Examples include:

-   how to make a specific type of plot (line, scatter, bar, etc)
-   how to customize the color scheme of a plot
-   how to convert from one date-time type to another
-   how a single function can help solve a common data cleaning problem

In the coming days, you and your group will decide on a specific thing
you'd like to teach and begin building your curriculum from there.

Over the course of the workshop, when you see a section labeled **Group
Work**, it's a sign for you to assemble with your group members to
develop a new part of your curriculum.

On Thursday and Friday of next week, each group will take us through
their lesson. You will have **30 minutes total** to introduce your
topic, teach it with live coding, and deliver a brief assessment.
Afterwards we will have 10 minutes of feedback before moving on to the
next group. This is a short amount of time, so the topic of your
curriculum must be very concise. We will work together to pick an
appropriate topic for each group.

### Code of Conduct

Let's take a few minutes to familiarize ourselves with the [The
Carpentries Code of
Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
be reported by following our [reporting
guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-reporting.html).

## Learning Objectives

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

-   teach with a growth mindset, and encourage a growth mindset in
    students;
-   comfortably lead live coding sessions;
-   design lessons and assessments using the principles of backward
    design.

## Prerequisites

Before joining this training, participants should:

-   have the latest versions of [R and
    RStudio](https://bertozzivill.github.io/r-install-instructions)
    installed (see below).
-   have some familiarity with programming in Python or R, especially
    making plots in either language.
