Welcome to our workshop! We're so glad you're here.

As you advance in your scientific careers, one of your responsibilities
will be to pass your skills and knowledge on to others. You could do
this in a formal academic setting, a semi-formal workshop like the one
we're in now, or via one-on-one instruction. In any setting, there are a
series of principles and techniques that will help you teach in a way
that others find effective and engaging.

This two-week training session is designed to help you learn these
principles and techniques. Our nine days together will involve a mix of
lectures, discussion, small group work, and teaching practice.
