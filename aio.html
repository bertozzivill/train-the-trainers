On the flip side, there are people who do not have a particular passion

<p>Imagine that one day, a child draws a picture of a tree. He shows it
to his older sister, his mother, and his aunt.</p>
<p>His older sister says, “That’s a terrible drawing, you’re bad at
art.”</p>
<p>His mother says, “That drawing is perfect!! You’re an amazing
artist!”</p>
<p>His aunt says, “This is so good! I love the details around the
leaves. I bet it would look beautiful next time if you tried putting
some darker shading behind the trunk.”</p>
<p>How do you think the child felt after receiving each of these three
pieces of feedback?</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The exercise above showed people giving three different types of
feedback. The sister gave harsh negative feedback, claiming that the
child was categorically bad at art. The mother gave gushing positive
feedback, claiming that the child was categorically good at art. The
aunt gave some positive feedback, while also gently suggesting ways that
the child might improve in the future.</p>
<p>The child’s mother and sister were both demonstrating what
psychologist Carol Dweck calls a <strong>fixed mindset</strong>. This is
the belief that ability or intelligence is born rather than made. The
child’s aunt, on the other hand, was demonstrating the belief that
ability can be acquired through effort– a <strong>growth
mindset</strong>. Especially when learning something that feels complex
or intimidating, a fixed mindset can interfere with motivation and
growth in a number of ways, as laid out in this diagram:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/perquiro_growth.png" alt="Fixed vs Growth Mindsets." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">Fixed vs Growth Mindsets.</div>
</figure><p>It’s important for you to try and encourage a growth mindset in your
learners, and the best way to do so is to embody a growth mindset
yourself. Let’s go through a few common challenges instructors encounter
and consider how we might bring a growth mindset to them.</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>How might someone with a fixed mindset respond to each of these
common challenges? What about someone with a growth mindset?</p>
<ul>
<li>A learner asks you a question you don’t know the answer to.</li>
<li>You’re doing a live coding demonstration, and your code throws an
error when you didn’t expect it to.</li>
<li>You’re helping someone write a few lines of code, but they’re a slow
typer. It would be faster if you took their computer and did it yourself
as they watched.</li>
<li>A student is feeling frustrated and tells you, “I’m just no good at
coding!”.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ll go into more detail about how to cultivate a growth mindset in
the classroom next week. But for now, let’s spend a little time
cultivating a growth mindset in ourselves by practicing giving and
receiving feedback.</p>
</section><section id="ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"><h2 class="section-heading">ASK for Feedback: Actionable, Specific, and Kind<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-for-feedback-actionable-specific-and-kind"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are many metaphors and acronyms designed to help people give
good feedback. One of our favorites is called the ASK framework. It
recommends that any feedback you provide to someone should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Actionable</strong>: If you critique someone on something
they have no power to change, your feedback has limited power to help
them grow. Furthermore, they may wind up feeling demotivated, or even
defensive. Stick to the possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Specific</strong>: “Make it better” is actionable feedback,
but it doesn’t really help guide someone towards a better product. It’s
much more helpful to specify where, how, and why you’re recommending
changes. For example, “I think the narrative is clearer if you switch
these two paragraphs”, or “on line 76, you’re taking the median value of
your data, but it would be more appropriate to take the mean”.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kind</strong>: Even if you strongly dislike the thing you’re
critiquing, it’s likely that someone spent a lot of time and effort on
it. If you have ever had someone absolutely rip apart something
meaningful to you, you know how crushing it can be. Think about the
words you use. If you’re speaking to someone directly, think about your
body language and tone. Remember what it felt like the last time someone
was gentle with you. There are two sub-strategies that work well to
support kind feedback:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Good news first</em>: Start by talking about the aspects of the
work you enjoyed, and acknowledging the effort that went into it. This
helps the feedback receiver to feel secure and open to receiving more
critical comments.</li>
<li>
<em>“I” statements</em>: When you are, for example, reviewing a
paper, sometimes it’s tempting to say “this section is confusing.” But
you don’t actually know that for sure! It was confusing to you, but
clearly it made sense to the person who wrote it, and maybe it would
also make sense to someone else. When you give feedback, instead
consider saying “I was confused by this section because…” and continue
with actionable, specific feedback. This is both a more true reflection
of your critique, and a kinder way of providing comments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul></section><section id="ask-to-ask"><h2 class="section-heading">Ask to ASK<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ask-to-ask"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There’s another reason we love the acronym ASK for feedback: it
reminds us that the giving of feedback should always be preceded by a
<em>question</em>. Usually, someone asks you for feedback, but
occasionally it’s also appropriate for you to ask someone if they would
like your opinion. Ideally, requests to receive or give feedback should
also follow the ASK protocol. For example, say “Hey, I made a figure for
a paper but I’m not sure if it’s easy to understand, could you tell me
what story this plot tells you?” instead of “What do you think of this
plot?” This will help guide the feedback-giver toward the actual type of
advice you’re hoping to receive.</p>

</section><section id="managing-discomfort"><h2 class="section-heading">Managing Discomfort<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#managing-discomfort"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even when feedback is actively solicited and given in the kindest
possible way, it can feel terrible to receive. Many of us, especially
those of us who grew up with a fixed mindset, often want our first try
to be perfect. When someone gives us tips on how to improve, we can feel
humiliated, defensive, and demotivated, because we have not lived up to
the standard we set for ourselves.</p>
<p>The process of sitting with and moving past the discomfort that comes
with feedback is a crucial component of developing a growth mindset.
Everyone develops their own strategy to work through this. Here’s an
example of how one of your instructors does it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>For a few minutes, let myself feel whatever I need to. That person
just didn’t <em>understand</em> me! What do <em>they</em> know anyway?
Oh no, am I <em>terrible at this</em>? What if I’m <em>never</em>
successful?</li>
<li>Start to “reality test” those high-emotion thoughts. Do I really
think the person who gave me feedback didn’t know what they were talking
about? Do I really think that I’m bad at this, or am I proud of the
effort I put in? Don’t I want to learn how to do better? Isn’t the only
way to be successful to keep trying?</li>
<li>When I’m ready, sit back down with the feedback and really think
through it. What good points did this person make? What feedback can I
respectfully decline? It’s usually at this point that I actually start
getting excited about incorporating the feedback, because I can see how
it will make my work stronger.</li>
<li>Continue incorporating and refining the feedback. At this point I’m
usually really happy and grateful that I asked for help. If I can, I’ll
thank the person who gave me feedback. I might feel kind of silly for
how I responded before, but I know that it’s a human response that will
happen again. I trust myself to handle it appropriately next time it
happens.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Carpentries aims to teach computational competence to learners.
Following them, in this course we take an applied approach, avoiding the
theoretical and general in favor of the practical and specific. By
showing learners how to solve specific problems with specific tools and
providing hands-on practice, we develop learners’ confidence and lay the
foundation for future learning.</p>
<p>A critical component of this process is that learners are able to
practice what they are learning in real time, get feedback on what they
are doing, and then apply those lessons learned to the next step in the
learning process. Having learners help each other during the workshops
also helps to reinforce concepts taught during the workshops.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>a workshop is an interactive event</strong> –
for learners and instructors. We give and receive feedback throughout
the course of a workshop. We incorporate assessments within the lesson
materials and ask for feedback on sticky notes during lunch breaks and
at the end of each day.</p>
<p>One reason why practice and feedback are so important is because a
workshop is not simply a source of information; it is the starting point
for development of a new skill. To understand what this means, we will
start by exploring what research tells us about skill acquisition and
development of a “mental model.”</p>

<p>Our approach is based on the work of researchers like Patricia
Benner, who applied the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" class="external-link">Dreyfus
model of skill acquisition</a> in her studies of <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0270467604265061" class="external-link">how
nurses progress from novice to expert</a> (<a href="https://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3ABenner%2C+Patricia+E." class="external-link">see
also books by Benner</a>). This work indicates that through practice and
formal instruction, learners acquire skills and advance through distinct
stages. In simplified form, three stages of this model are:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/skill-level.svg" alt='Three people, labeled from left to right as "Novice", "Competent Practitioner", and "Expert". Underneath,an arrow labelled "Experience level" points from left to right. The "Novice" is quoted, "I am not sure what questions to ask." The Competent Practitioner is quoted, "I am pretty confident, but I still look stuff up a lot!" The Expert is quoted "I have been doing this on a daily basis for years!"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ul>
<li>
<p><em>Novice</em>: someone who does not know what they do not know,
i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or how
they relate. Novices may have difficulty formulating questions, or may
ask questions that seem irrelevant or off-topic as they rely on prior
knowledge, without knowing what is or is not related yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>novice</em> learner in a data visualization workshop
might never have made a plot using code, and may have no understanding
of how to load data into an R or Python workspace, much less visualize
it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Competent practitioner</em>: someone who has enough
understanding for everyday purposes. They will not know all the details
of how something works and their understanding may not be entirely
accurate, but it is sufficient for completing normal tasks with normal
effort under normal circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: A <em>competent practitioner</em> in a data visualization
workshop might have used <code>ggplot2</code> or <code>matplotlib</code>
before and knows how to generate common plots (line, scatter, bar) using
default color schemes, but may not know how to customize appearance,
labeling, color, or faceting.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Expert</em>: someone who can easily handle situations that
are out of the ordinary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: An <em>expert</em> in a data visualization workshop may have
extensive experience creating high-quality plots for publication and
presentation, as well as an understanding of visualization theory. When
presented with complex data to visualize, they may immediately come up
with creative ideas to tell an effective story.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that how a person <em>feels</em> about their skill level is not
included in these definitions! You may or may not consider yourself an
expert in a particular subject, but may nonetheless function at that
level in certain contexts. We will come back to the expertise of the
instructor and its impact – positive and negative – on teaching, in a
few episodes. For now, we are primarily concerned with novices, as this
is often our primary target audience.</p>
<p>It is common to think of a novice as a sort of an “empty vessel” into
which knowledge can be “poured.” Unfortunately, this analogy includes
inaccuracies that can generate dangerous misconceptions. In our next
section, we will briefly explore the nature of “knowledge” through a
concept that helps us differentiate between novices and competent
practitioners in a more useful and visual way. This, in turn, will have
implications for how we teach.</p>

<p>Understanding is never a mirror of reality, even for an expert;
rather, it is an internal representation based on our experience with a
subject. This internal representation is often described as a
<strong>mental model</strong>. A mental model allows us to extrapolate,
or make predictions beyond and between the narrow limits of experience
and memory, filling in gaps to the point that things “make sense.”</p>
<p>As we learn, our mental model evolves to become more complex and,
most importantly, more useful. A useful model makes reasonable
predictions and fits well within the range of things we are likely to
encounter. While there will always be inaccuracies – or “misconceptions”
– these do not interfere with day-to-day functioning. A useful model
does not seize up or break down entirely as new concepts are added.</p>

<p>Some mental models can be succinctly summarized by comparison to
something else that is more universally understood. Good analogies can
be extraordinarily useful when teaching, because they draw upon an
existing mental model to fill in another, speeding learning and making a
memorable connection. However, all analogies have limitations! If you
choose to use an analogy, be sure its usefulness outweighs its potential

<p>People often ask where our name came from. Greg Wilson has this to

<p>“Brent Gorda and I came up with the name in 1998 to differentiate
what we were teaching from software engineering. That’s about digging
the Channel Tunnel; we’re about the computational equivalent of hanging
drywall.”</p>
<p>The word “carpentry” acts as a metaphor – a type of analogy –

<p>A mental model may be represented as a collection of concepts and
facts, connected by relationships. The mental model of an expert in any
given subject will be far larger and more complex than that of a novice,
including both more concepts and more detailed and numerous
relationships. However, <strong>both may be perfectly useful</strong> in
certain contexts.</p>
<p>Returning to our example levels of skill development:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em>novice</em> has a minimal mental model of surface features of
the domain. Inaccuracies based on limited prior knowledge may interfere
with adding new information. Predictions are likely to borrow heavily
from mental models of other domains which seem superficially
similar.</li>
<li>A <em>competent practitioner</em> has a mental model that is useful
for everyday purposes. Most new information they are likely to encounter
will fit well with their existing model. Even though many potential
elements of their mental model may still be missing or wrong,
predictions about their area of work are usually accurate.</li>
<li>An <em>expert</em> has a densely populated and connected mental
model that is especially good for problem solving. They quickly connect
concepts that others may not see as being related. They may have
difficulty explaining how they are thinking in ways that do not rely on
other features unique to their own mental model.</li>

<p>Most people do not naturally visualize a mental model as a diagram of
concepts and relationships. Mental models are complicated! Yet, visual
representation of concepts and relationships can be a useful way to
explore and understand hidden features of a mental model.</p>
<p>There are certain ways in which you may routinely use visual
organizers, such as flow charts or biochemical pathway diagrams. A more
general tool that is useful for exploring any network of concepts and
relationships is a <strong>concept map</strong>. Pioneered for classroom
use by John Novak in the 1970s, a concept map asks you to identify which
concepts are most relevant to a topic at hand and – critically – to
identify how they are connected. It can be quite difficult to identify
and organize these connections! However, the process of forcing abstract
knowledge into a visual format can force you to name connections that
you might otherwise have quietly assumed, or illuminate gaps that you
may not have been aware of. Especially where analogies are not
available, concept mapping can help you to make your mental model of a
concept more clear to yourself or others.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a mental model of the relationship between a
small ball and water in a full glass.</p>
<p>The concept map below illustrates a simple mental model that a young
child might develop after putting the ball in the water.</p>

<p>The mental model above connects a ball to the water it can displace,
recognizing that ‘more’ ball can move ‘more’ water. This mental model is
perfectly functional for a child who wants to have fun splashing water
around. It may endure in this way for several years of beaches and
bathtubs.</p>
<p>However, when this child is asked to predict what would happen to the
water if a ball were not bigger or smaller but <em>heavier</em> or
<em>lighter</em>, they will naturally apply their existing mental model
to the task. BUT…</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ballwater3a.svg" alt='A concept map similar to the previous one except with "Heavy Ball" and "Light Ball" in the middle, and a red "X" over the arrows labeled "Pushes out MORE" and "Pushes out LESS"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>What a surprise! The challenge presented by this new information is
that it clashes with the pre-existing mental model, to which it seemed
to apply. This prior knowledge needs to be adjusted to a new
understanding that incorporates the difference between properties of
mass and volume.</p>
<figure><img src="fig/ballwater4a.svg" alt='A new concept map. "Ball" remains at left, and "Water", at right. "Size" and "Weight" are stacked vertically between them. Arrows from "Ball" share the label "Can have more or less." One arrow from "size to "water" is labeled "Affects pushing of"' class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>When mental models break, learning can occur more slowly than you
might expect. The longer a prior model was in use, and the more
extensively it has to be <em>unlearned</em>, the more it can actively
interfere with the incorporation of new knowledge. Our child may quickly
adapt to this new information if they had never thought much about mass
before and were simply trying out an existing mental model on a new
situation. However, if they had extensive experience with balls that
were both larger and heavier (for example), it may take longer to
unlearn what they thought they understood about mass.</p>
<p>Most mental models worth mapping are not so simple. Yet, forcing
complex ideas in to this simplified format can be useful when preparing
to teach, because it forces you to be explicit about exactly what
concepts are at the heart of your topic, and to name relationships
between them.</p>

</h3>
<p>Correcting learners’ misconceptions is at least as important as
presenting them with correct information. There are many ways of
classifying different types of misconceptions. For our purposes, it is
useful to consider 3 broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple <em>factual errors</em>. These exist in isolation from any
deeper understanding. These are the easiest to correct. Example:
believing that Dar es Salaam is the capital of Tanzania.</li>
<li>
<em>Broken models</em>. These occur when inaccuracies explain
relationships and generate predictions (often successfully!) in an
existing mental model. These take time to address, demanding that
learners reason carefully through examples to see contradictions.
Examples: believing that humid air causes malaria, or that seasons are
related to the shape of the earth’s orbit.</li>
<li>
<em>Fundamental beliefs</em>, which are deeply connected to a
learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change. Examples: “the
world is only a few thousand years old” or “human beings cannot affect
the planet’s climate”. “I am not a computational person” may, arguably,
also fall into this category of misconception.</li>
</ul>
<p>The middle category of misconceptions is the most useful type to
watch out for in workshops. While teaching, we want to expose learners’
broken models so that we can help them begin to deconstruct them and
build better ones in their place.</p>

<p>In order to effectively root out pre-existing misconceptions that
need to be un-learned and stop quietly developing misconceptions in
their tracks, an instructor needs to be actively and persistently
looking for them. But how?</p>
<p>Like so many challenges we will discuss in this training, the answer
is <strong>feedback</strong>. In this case, we want feedback that allows
us to <strong>assess</strong> the developing mental model of a trainee
in highly specific ways, to verify that learning is proceeding according
to plan and not careening off in some unpredicted direction. We want to
get this feedback <strong>while we teach</strong> so that we can respond
to that information and adapt our instruction to get learners back on
track.</p>
<p>This kind of assessment has a name: it is called <strong>formative
assessment</strong> because it is applied during learning to form the
practice of teaching and the experience of the learner. This is
different from exams, for example, which sum up what a participant has
learned but are not immediately used to guide further progress and are
hence called <strong>summative</strong>.</p>
<p>Feedback from formative assessment illuminates misconceptions for
both instructors and learners. It also provides reassurance on both
sides when learning <em>is</em> proceeding on track! It is far more
reliable than reading faces or using feelings of comfort as a metric,
which tends to be what instructors and learners default to
otherwise.</p>

<p>Formative assessments can serve many purposes other than hunting down
misconceptions, such as verifying engagement or supporting memory
consolidation. We will discuss some of these functions in later
episodes. In this section, we are interested quite narrowly in
evaluating mental models.</p>
<p>One example of formative assessment that can be used to tease out
misconceptions is the multiple choice question (MCQ). When designed
carefully, these can target anticipated misconceptions with surgical
precision. For example, suppose we are teaching children multi-digit
addition. A well-designed MCQ would be:</p>
<pre class="source"><code>Q: what is 27 + 15 ?

a) 42
b) 32
c) 312
d) 33</code></pre>
<p>The correct answer is 42, but each of the other answers provides
valuable insight.</p>

<p>Designing a few MCQs with diagnostic power is useful when preparing
to teach even if they are never used, for the same reason that concept
mapping can be useful: it forces the instructor to think about the
learners’ mental models and try to anticipate how they might be broken.
In short, it helps Instructors to put themselves into the learners’
heads and see the topic from their point of view. We will talk more
about the process of preparing to teach in a later episode.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>It takes work to actively assess mental models throughout a workshop;
this also takes time. This can make Instructors feel conflicted about
using formative assessment routinely. However, the need to conduct
routine assessment is not the only reason why a workshop <strong>should
proceed more slowly than you think</strong>.</p>
<p>One key insight from research on cognitive development is that
novices, competent practitioners, and experts each need to be taught
differently. In particular, presenting novices with a pile of facts
early on is counter-productive, because they do not yet have a model or
framework to fit those facts into. In fact, <strong>presenting too many
facts too soon can actually reinforce an incorrect mental
model</strong>. (This is a key problem with the “empty vessel” analogy
described earlier.)</p>
<p>Learners coming to data science workshops may be novices, and do not
have a strong mental model of the concepts we are teaching. Thus, our
primary goal is <strong>not</strong> to teach the syntax of a particular
programming language, but <strong>to help them construct a working
mental model</strong> so that they have something to attach facts to. In
other words, our goal is to teach people <strong>how to think</strong>
about programming and data management in a way that will allow them to
learn more easily on their own or understand what they might find
online.</p>

<p>If our goal is to help novices construct an accurate and useful
mental model of a new intellectual domain, this will impact our
teaching. For example, we principally want to help learners form the
right categories and make connections among concepts. We <em>do not</em>
want to overload them with a slew of unrelated facts, as this will be
confusing.</p>
<p>An important practical implication of this latter point is the pace
at which we teach.<br>
In the <a href="TODO">data visualization training Gloria Shirima ran in
Kigali</a>, we only covered two types of plot (line and scatter) for
three hours of teaching. An hour and a half per command may seem
glacially slow, but that course’s real purpose was to teach learners
about the fundamental theory of plot creation, especially the concepts
of layers and aesthetic mappings. From that foundation, constructing
more involved and complex plots will be much easier.</p>
<p>That mental model of ggplot also includes things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating informative variable names (so you can differentiate
between a multiple of plots in one script).</li>
<li>Writing code in scripts rather than the console (to ensure you don’t
lose it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning consists of more than “just” adding information to mental
models; creating linkages between concepts and facts is at least as
important. Telling people that they should name things nicely and
consistently, and that they should focus on the location and protection
of the code they write, both set the stage for discussing of code
hygiene and replicability. We’re laying foundations of the practices we
want to promote even when not discussing them directly.</p>

<p>Strong workshops is that we meet learners <em>where they are</em>.
Instructors strive to help learners progress from whatever starting
point they happen to be at, without making anyone feel inferior about
their current practices or skillsets. We do this in part by teaching
relevant and useful skills, building an inclusive learning environment,
and continually getting (and paying attention to!) feedback from
learners. We will be talking in more depth about each of these
strategies as we go forward in our workshop.</p>

<p>Let’s imagine that tomorrow morning your boss knocks on your door and
tells you that she needs you to prepare a data science training for a
group of Master’s students that will be arriving next month. You know
that the students have R installed and know how to run code, but have
never worked with data before. You’re going to be giving a two-day
workshop, five hours each day.</p>
<p>Also imagine that you can’t just go online and teach a ready-made
data science course.</p>
<p>How will you begin building out your curriculum?</p>

<p>The world of data science is so vast that it’s difficult to know
where to start. Probably, you started by listing off the topics that you
thought were good beginner material, and then putting them in some sort
of reasonable order so that you can write a lesson plan for each.</p>
<p>While this is a strategy that can result in good curricula, here we
will be recommending a different way to develop lessons: one that begins
with what skills you want the students to have by the
<strong>end</strong> of the workshop. From there, you work backwards to
determine what the course content should look like.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training, we will use a modified version of Nicholl’s five phase
paradigm for curriculum design<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Nicholls’ paradigm describes a process,
commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, where those who wish
to develop a new curriculum first begin by defining exactly what their
learners will be able to do <em>after they have completed the
lesson/training/course</em>. The subsequent stages of the curriculum
design process involve designing content to directly meet those stated
outcomes. The Carpentries developed the modified version of Nicholls’
system that we will use in this workshop:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching</li>
<li>Evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="fig/cldt-design-process.svg" style="width:67.0%" alt="A flow diagram presenting the process of lesson design and development used in this training." class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Note that the assessment framework here focuses on
<em>formative</em>, rather than <em>summative</em>, assessments. Because
of the shorter nature of the course we focus on assessing and modifying
progress <em>while the teaching is still going on</em>, to give
instructors opportunities to evaluate the teaching and lesson content
before the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>We will conduct a small summative assessment in the form of an exit
survey that you will complete at the end of the session. This final
survey will help us iterate and refine the content as a whole for future
trainings.</p>
<p>Note the cyclical nature of the lesson design process: you will
complete one iteration through this cycle during this training. Note
also that <em>teaching the content</em> is an essential intermediate
step in the process: the importance of feedback gathered while teaching
the lesson will be a common refrain throughout this training.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Over these two weeks, we will be focusing on helping you develop a
single short lesson to teach the fundamentals of curriculum design.
However, these same skills can be used to build out a much more
extensive curriculum (like the one you’re learning now). And because so
many of the skills you might be teaching are in high demand, it’s likely
that you may be asked to conduct more trainings than you can possibly
have the bandwidth for. Because of this, as you’re designing larger
courses it may be useful to consider developing a pipeline for tested,
shareable curricula that others can pick up and teach. The Carpentries
have a lovely model for this type of sharing that we’d like to take a
moment to discuss here.</p>
<p>The Carpentries community develops open source lessons, which can
always be updated and may never be <em>finished</em>. A lesson can
undergo many iterations before it reaches a relatively stable state. To
reflect this, we encourage lesson developers to indicate the status of
their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life
cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the pre-alpha stage. It enters alpha when it is taught for the first time. In beta, it is taught by other instructors. A full release of the lesson is made when it is stable. Pilot workshops take place during the alpha and beta phases." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The life cycle of a lesson</div>
</figure><p>Each life cycle stage indicates the level of maturity of a
lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still
being constructed.</li>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the
original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by
instructors who have not been significantly involved in its developed to
this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by
the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and
unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although your lesson will probably remain in pre-alpha throughout
this training, some of the content will be equally valuable at later
stages and we will also point you towards resources to help with testing
the lesson and gathering feedback.</p>

<section id="target-audience"><h2 class="section-heading">Target Audience<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#target-audience"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to
define the scope of the lesson, i.e. what people need to know before and
what they will know after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the
target audience will help you with this and defining desired learning
outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently displaying a
description of the target audience will also help attract people with
the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend your
workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target
audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to
the skills taught by your lesson. Recall our conversation from last
section about the <a href="skill-models-misconceptions.html">three
different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner,
and expert</a> and how it directly correlates to the complexity of
mental models these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not
know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or
how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of
the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who
can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can
immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a
new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level
of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This
can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior
knowledge<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what
<em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that
misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners
try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model. (More on
this in <a href="formative-assessment.html"><em>Stay On
Target</em></a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught
differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that
include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e. focused on a
specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but
without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant.
However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent
practitioners who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of
something they already have the prior knowledge of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For learners at this
level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners
the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are
likely to be more effective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the
motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of
your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems
they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see
the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson
will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the
literature).</p>
<p>We will look more at strategies to establish value and build positive
expectancies in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="be-specific">Be Specific<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-specific"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms,
for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at “PhD students” or
“early career researchers”. However, taking the time to focus on real
people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will
help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence
how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you
notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience
are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you
are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with
different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of
expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a
wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for
the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too
little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the
lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too
much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of
learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of
your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson,
alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you
expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you
have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners
when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic
questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the
answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended
audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with
caution: people are often bad at self-assessment i.e. estimating our own
ability to perform a task<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We can try to mitigate for this when
designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room
for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience
suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop
falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

our iterative design process: defining the skills and knowledge we want
learners to leave with.</div>
</figure><p>At this stage of the training, you should have a clear idea of who
the target audience is for your lesson, and what knowledge, skills, and
abilities you expect them to arrive with. Now it is time to consider the
additional knowledge, skills, and abilities they will have by the time
they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It
can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like
this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development
process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to
determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the
lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be
included.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels
relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills
rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are
empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to
them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them
to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you
prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the
biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section id="learning-objectives"><h2 class="section-heading">Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson
should be new skills, i.e. things that the learner can do. For the vast
majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things
learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds
of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making
sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static
website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we
can <em>apply</em> concepts and <em>create</em> something new, we must
attain the ability to <em>remember</em> and <em>distinguish</em> between
new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are
often faster to gain then applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can
move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why
the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners
will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the
outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to
focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for
learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss
anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that
could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>

<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one)
skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written
in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner
has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills
described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule,
action verbs such as “explain,” “choose,” or “predict,” are more helpful
than passive verbs such as “know,” “understand,” or “appreciate”, which
are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" class="external-link">Bloom’s
Taxonomy</a>, which divides cognitive skills into several categories.
The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict hierarchy,
which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these skills
conform to such a hierarchy, Bloom’s Taxonomy serves as a very useful
bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.</p>
<p>We will see how helpful it can be to use action verbs in learning
objectives when we begin talking about exercise design in the coming
episodes.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>To assist you in defining and writing learning objectives for your
lesson, it can be helpful to turn to a popular framework for defining
goals: <em>SMART</em>. Originally <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf" class="external-link">proposed
to aid managers in the definition of business goals</a>, and updated and
adapted since to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria#Common_usage" class="external-link">several
other domains</a> including education (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5944406/" class="external-link"><em>How to
Write Well-Defined Learning Objectives</em></a> for example<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>), the
SMART acronym requires goals to be <em>specific</em>,
<em>measurable</em>, <em>attainable</em>, <em>relevant</em>, and
<em>time-bound</em>.</p>
<p>In the context of a lesson, SMART objectives should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular
skill or ability the learner should have.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and
ascertain when the learner has learned the skill/abilities described in
the objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be
able to acquire the skills or abilities in the time available in a
workshop/by following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall
topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe
within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is
built into the approach described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for any lesson/curriculum that will be taught in a fixed
amount of time, <em>attainable</em> and <em>time-bound</em> are
overlapping: learning objectives for your lesson will answer the
question “What will learners be able to do by the end of this lesson?”
and the time available to teach the lesson, combined with the expected
prior knowledge of your target audience, will determine how attainable
they are.</p>

objective, but it illustrates how difficult it can be to make an
objective truly specific. For example, a more specific and measurable

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to
include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they
will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time
can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short
form training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often
need to be made about what can and cannot be included. Trying to fit too
much content into a lesson is counter-productive<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is good to
avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover
properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking
about this lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced
with a difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be
acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire “higher-level” cognitive
skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire
the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain.
Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless
you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the
relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably
unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its
end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes,
lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a
particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices
about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the
context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have discussed the importance of defining objectives early in the
lesson design process, and looked at some examples of objectives written
for other lessons. Now it is time to begin defining objectives for your
own.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 3-4 objectives for every 6 hours your lesson will take to
teach. (For example, this curriculum is designed to be taught in ~18
hours and has <a href="index.html#learning-objectives">ten learning
objectives</a>.)</li>
<li>These objectives are for your lesson as a whole: try to define the
“end point” knowledge and skills you want learners to acquire. You can
think of these as the things you would test in a fictional “final exam”
your learners would be able to tackle.</li>
<li>Later you will write “episode-level” objectives that should define
intermediate steps towards the high-level objectives you identify for
your lesson here.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a simplified model of memory individuals are equipped with two
types of memory: working (also called short-term) and long-term.
Long-term memory essentially has unlimited storage but is slow to
access, whereas working memory is quicker to access but can only hold a
limited number of items at a time. For teaching, the goal is to help
learners move the new things they’ve learned from working memory into
long-term memory. One of the ways lesson developers can aid in this
process is through exercises.</p>
<p>In addition to checking for misconceptions and broken mental models,
exercises help move new skills and concepts into long-term memory by
providing learners an opportunity to practice what was recently learned.
These exercises should occur frequently throughout the lesson because
they move items to long-term memory and free up learners’ working memory
for new items.</p>
<p>Creating exercises builds upon the learning objectives you created
earlier in the lesson design process. You can design exercises based on
the actions/skills you described in your learning objectives (the
learning outcomes you intend for the lesson). This will be easier if
your wrote learning objectives with specific action verbs. Specific
verbs can help you decide what action you want the learners to perform
in the exercise. E.g. actions such as “explain” and “describe” may be
better assessed by discussions and multiple choice questions, while
“solve,” “construct,” “test” and other higher-level cognitive skills may
be better assessed by debugging tasks, <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#code-run" class="external-link">code-and-run</a>,
or use-in-a-different-context exercises.</p>

<p>The Trainers will assign you to pairs or small groups, and give each

<p>Then, discuss the following questions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of skills would an exercise of this type assess? Try to
identify some action verbs like those we used to write lesson objectives
earlier in the workshop.</li>
<li>Would this type of exercise be suited to a novice audience? Or is it
a better fit for intermediate or advanced learners?</li>
<li>Would this kind of exercise work well in an in-person workshop
setting? Would it be better suited to self-directed learning and/or a
virtual workshop?</li>
</ul>
<p>Share the major points of your discussion in the collaborative notes
document.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>As you discussed with your group in the last exercise, different
types of learning objectives work better for novices, while others are a
better fit for competent practitioners or experts.</p>
<p>This can be understood in terms of the types of exercises that suit
the objective: exercise types that help manage cognitive load for the
learner, such as <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#fill-in-the-blanks" class="external-link">fill-in-the-blanks</a>,
<a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#faded-examples" class="external-link">faded
examples</a> or <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#parsons-problem" class="external-link">Parsons
problems</a> (which all provide a lot of the guiding process/scaffolding
code and allow the learner to focus on a specific concept or skill) are
a good fit for a novice, to whom all elements of the topic are new.
However, these kinds of exercise do not provide an opportunity for
learners to develop higher-level skills, such as the ability to create
whole new functions or scripts, or to extrapolate from the examples they
have seen to solve a different kind of problem. Indeed, example and
exercise types that are helpful to novices may even be
counter-productive for learners with a greater level of expertise<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus you want to choose your objectives to fit your intended audience
and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.</p>

<p><em>“Different types of lesson objectives (LOs) are better fit for
novices, while others are better fit for competent practitioners, etc.
and if exercises (formative assessments) are well aligned to LOs, [they]
will automatically serve the corresponding audience. Thinking in terms
of LOs (What should a learner do in order to achieve this specific LO?
Is this LO exactly what learners are expected to achieve by the end of
this piece of instruction? etc.) is easier than thinking in terms of LOs
+ audience + content. LOs should be tailored to the audience, and, if
this is well done, you may stop worrying about the audience. Create LOs
for the specific audience and create assessments for specific
LOs.”</em></p>

<p>Using one of the exercise formats you have learned about so far,
design an exercise that will require learners to perform one of the
actions described in the objectives you wrote earlier, and that assesses
their ability to do so.</p>
<p>These should be assessments of the lower-level objectives defined for
individual episodes in the lesson, as opposed to the lesson-level
objectives you wrote first.</p>
<p>Trainees working as a team can choose whether to work together on
discussing and designing a single exercise to assess a single objective,
or to divide their efforts and each focus on an exercise for their own
episode. If you choose to take the latter approach and finish with time
to spare, spend the remainder reviewing and providing feedback on one
another’s assessments.</p>

<p>After completing this episode, participants should be able to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify some actions that can be taken to build a strong foundation
for a lesson.</li>
<li>Identify valuable topics from the Carpentries lessons that will
<em>not</em> be covered in this workshop</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Last week, we focused on good practices for designing a lesson, and
provided opportunities to implement these practices. We included
theoretical topics such as theories of pedagogy and mental models, but
focused on practical strategies for effective teaching. Following the
principles of backward design, we learned how to identify a target
audience and their prerequisite knowledge, define course objectives, and
design formative assessments.</p>
<p>This week, we will introduce a few new concepts you will need, with
an emphasis on preparing you for the lessons you will teach at the end
of the week. We’ll start by talking about <strong>time
management</strong> and <strong>lesson planning</strong>. Next, we’ll
discuss <strong>tech setup</strong> and <strong>lesson content
creation</strong>. Finally, we’ll think about <strong>equity, inclusion,
and accessibility</strong> before moving on to <strong>live
coding</strong> and <strong>the physical act of teaching</strong>. Any
remaining time will be spent preparing for your live coding lessons.</p>
<p>We will spend all day Thursday on the live coding presentations, with
room for overflow into Friday. For the rest of the day on Friday, we
will review and reflect on the experience of teaching and how to
continue refining lessons in the future.</p>
<p>Due to our time constraints, we will not been able to review the full
range of teaching resources that the Carpentries have to offer. If
you’re interested in continuing to build your teaching skillset, we
strongly recommend that you explore the following resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/" class="external-link">Carpentries
Instructor Training</a> gives more detail about theories of instruction,
memory and cognitive load, what motivates and demotivates learners, and
how to get involved in Carpentries culture.</li>
<li>the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/index.html" class="external-link">Carpentries
Lesson Development Training</a> goes into more detail about backward
design and each specific step of creating and evaluating a curriculum.
We have covered quite a lot of this training, but not all of it. In
particular, we have omitted the details about how to create a
Carpentries course website like the one you’re reading now.</li>
<li>once you’ve reviewed the basics of Carpentries website setup in the
Lesson Development Training, you can head over to the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/" class="external-link">Carpentries
Workbench</a> and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/" class="external-link">Workbench

<hr class="half-width">
<p>A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session,
including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver
it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce
yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help
learners</li>
<li>setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the
lesson</li>
<li>the actual course content, whether in slide, lecture, or live coding
form as appropriate</li>
<li>assessments and checkpoints - places where you have planned to stop
to check-in with learners</li>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Checkpoints are especially useful at the beginning of a lesson when
you may not have as many exercises but the learners need to have the
data downloaded or tool opened to be able to follow along. A checkpoint
could include stopping to ask what questions learners have or having
them indicate if they have completed the most recent step shown by the
instructor.</p>

teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems on the spot can be
time-consuming and stressful.</p>

<h3 id="live-coding">Live Coding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#live-coding"></a>
</h3>
<p>If, like most Carpentries courses, you are teaching a skill that
involves coding, we strongly recommend the <strong>live coding</strong>
approach to teaching. In this framework, rather than focusing on slides
or lectures, participants learn by actively coding along with you, and
then practicing on their own during assessments. We also recommend that
you create a course website, both to act as a guide for you to follow
and so the participants can follow along. (This website also serves as
an accessible resource for those who cannot attend a workshop but want
to learn on their own.) More information about how to create these
websites can be found at the <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/index.html" class="external-link">Carpentries
Lesson Development Training</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="slides">Slides<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#slides"></a>
</h3>
<p>Whether you are live coding or not, often you will need to present
more theoretical concepts, or introduce an analogy or mental model in a
way that a programming IDE cannot accommodate. In these cases, it is
helpful to construct an engaging slide deck to convey this information.
Simply copy-pasting from the course website is not recommended– try to
find a narrative and visual structure better suited to a slide-based
communication format.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="whiteboardchalkboard">Whiteboard/Chalkboard<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#whiteboardchalkboard"></a>
</h3>
<p>For mathematics and physics classes especially, it is very useful to
be able to write on a board– but we also recommend that you have this
tool available whenever possible. (A portable tripod with a writing pad
on it is a good substitute). There are often moments where it adds value
to write live as a visual tool. And if you’re in a situation where the
power is liable to go out, you’ll want a backup way to continue with the
lesson.</p>

<p>The concept of <strong>hidden curriculum</strong> describes
curricular effects that influence learning but are not explicitly
addressed in the lesson content - e.g. (unofficial) social and cultural
norms, behaviours and values that are transferred by instructors to
learners, often unconsciously. These are all the additional things that
people learn about the topic from <em>the way</em> your lesson is
taught, rather than from its official content. It is worthwhile to spend
some time thinking about what learners could pick up from <em>the
way</em> your lesson is taught, as well as from its written content. You
can use Instructor Notes to guide instructors on some of the aspects of
the hidden curriculum of your lesson, e.g. to encourage them to follow
certain tried and tested practices.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>As we have seen, there are many teaching practices that can make your
workshop more positive and welcoming. However, no workshop occurs in a
vacuum: everyone’s experiences begin and end and are influenced by the
world beyond. In this section we will discuss some of the systemic
barriers that can result in members of some groups being excluded even
in an otherwise welcoming environment. The fact that some groups face
barriers that others do not means we cannot take a one size fits all
approach to creating a positive learning environment.</p>

<h3 id="definitions">Definitions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#definitions"></a>
</h3>
<p>This section addresses topics related to equity, inclusion, and
accessibility. These terms are increasingly common and may be familiar
to you, but not everyone understands or interprets them in the same way.
So, we will start with a few working definitions, adapted from the <a href="https://www.diversity.pitt.edu/education/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-glossary" class="external-link">University
of Pittsburgh DEI Glossary</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Equity:</strong> The proportional distribution of desirable
outcomes across groups. Sometimes confused with equality, equity refers
to outcomes while equality connotes equal treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion:</strong> Actively engaging traditionally excluded
individuals and/or groups in processes, activities and decisions in a
way that shares power. Inclusion promotes broad engagement, shared
participation, and advances authentic sense of belonging through safe,
positive, and nurturing environments.</p>
<p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Refers to the intentional design or
redesign of technology, policies, products, and services (to name a few)
that increase one’s ability to use, access, and obtain the respective
item. Each person is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same
information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same
services in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with
substantially equivalent ease of use.</p>

<p>In 2019, The Carpentries formed a task force that worked with our
community to identify 9 <a href="https://carpentries.org/values/" class="external-link">Core

<p>Barriers to accessibility encountered in a workshop are demotivating
at best and can exclude a learner entirely. What barriers might be
present in your workshop, and what can you do to remove them?</p>

</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Think of a time when you have been affected by, or noticed someone
else being affected by barriers to accessibility. This may have been at
a conference you attended where the elevator was out of service, or
maybe a class you were taking relied on audio delivery of content.
Describe what happened, how it impacted your (or someone else’s) ability
to be involved and what could have been done to provide better
accessibility in this case.</p>
<p>This exercise should take about 5 minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>While it may not be possible to anticipate all needs, it <em>is</em>
possible to get a good working structure in place without any knowledge
of what specific disabilities people might have. Having some
accommodations prepared also demonstrates care, helping learners to
trust that additional requests are likely to be well received.</p>
<p>If you are playing the host role (or part of it), note that our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/workshop_administration/email_templates.html#email-learners-before-workshop" class="external-link">host
template</a> includes an inquiry regarding accessibility needs. However,
be aware that <strong>many people will not feel comfortable requesting
accommodations in advance</strong>, or at all if it can be avoided. For
example, a participant who is hard of hearing may simply hope that
instructors will speak loudly enough for them to hear. Taking steps to
make your workshop maximally accessible can relieve your participants of
the need to disclose personal information.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="from-accommodation-to-universal-design">From Accommodation to Universal Design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#from-accommodation-to-universal-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>Accommodation means changing things to serve an individual with a
demonstrated need. However, <strong>accommodation puts the onus on the
individual with the need</strong> to have to disclose their disability
and ask for accommodations. Reluctance to do so is understandable:
requests for accommodation are often met with negative emotions such as
uncertainity, confusion, annoyance or anger by those receiving the
requests.</p>
<p>By contrast, “universal design” means creating something to be
maximally usable by all people without additional changes. A good
example of universal design is curb cuts and sidewalk ramps. While they
were originally created to make it easier for wheelchair users to move
around, they proved to be equally helpful to people with strollers and
grocery carts.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, the Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST)
brought Universal Design into Education with the <a href="https://udlguidelines.cast.org" class="external-link">Universal Design in Learning (UDL)
Framework</a>. UDL places responsibility for accessibility on the course
designer rather than on the learner. It states that the most inclusive
approach to education is to design instruction with diverse learners in
mind from the beginning.</p>
<p>UDL is not about finding the one, best way to teach everyone. The key
to UDL is creating redundancies such that learners have multiple options
in how they:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>receive</li>
<li>engage, and</li>
<li>share information.</li>

<p>Looking at people who work with disability and accessibility, it’s
easy to be overwhelmed by all the different ways we could make
instruction more accessible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>It is ok not to do everything at once.</em> We do not ask
learners in our workshops to adopt all our best practices or tools in
one go, but instead to add things gradually at a rate they can manage.
Similarly, try to build in accessibility habits when preparing for
workshops through reflective practice, adding something new each
time.</li>
<li>
<em>Do the easy things first.</em> There are plenty of ways to make
workshops more accessible that are both quick to accomplish and minimal
in demands on attention: font choices, text size, checking in advance
that your room is accessible via an elevator or ramp, etc.</li>

<p>As Instructors, many aspects of our classroom environment are within
our control or influence. However, the world is a complicated place, and
there will always be extraneous factors that contribute to demotivation
and add to cognitive load. These vary from person to person, but members
of certain groups often carry a heavier load due to systemic forces that
disproportionately impact them. What we can control, in this case, is
our own awareness of the challenges these forces present to teaching and
learning. As with other demotivation pitfalls, we can also think
carefully about the language that we use and how we interact with our
learners to avoid reinforcing systemic bias.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="stereotypes">Stereotypes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>We all use stereotypes, and for good reason. They serve a cognitive
purpose. <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1566" class="external-link">One
study</a> suggests we encounter more than 34 gigabytes of information
every day. That is more information than we could ever process, so our
brains use shortcuts. What an expert thing to do! Stereotypes are one of
those shortcuts. As with other models, they are all wrong… but some are
dangerous.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-are-stereotypes">What are stereotypes?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-are-stereotypes"></a>
</h3>
<p>Stereotypes are an established feature of human social cognition, in
which a set of characteristics is associated with members of a group.
Sterotypes:</p>
<ul>
<li>may be explicit (conscious and deliberate) or implicit (unconscious
and automatic)</li>
<li>guide what we notice about people</li>
<li>guide how we interpret people’s behaviors</li>
<li>can facilitate quick judgements in appropriate situations
(e.g. stopping a child from driving a car)</li>
<li>can lead to systematically negative attitudes and behaviors towards
members of certain groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Stereotypes are dangerous when they are explicit, but they are
especially hazardous when they are implicit. This means that the people
holding them may not be aware of them, even though their perceptions are
guided by them.</p>
<p><strong>When Instructors have stereotypes about learners</strong>,
this may lead them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>call attention to differences unnecessarily</li>
<li>give more or less attention to certain learners</li>
<li>respond to questions differently for certain learners</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When learners experience stereotypes about
themselves</strong>, they may:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop a fixed mindset about aspects of their own capability</li>
<li>experience increased cognitive load when reminded about a
stereotype, interfering with the learning process. This is known as
<em>stereotype threat</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way to support at-risk learners of all kinds is to ask people to
sign up for workshops in small teams rather than as individuals when
possible. If an entire lab group comes, or if attendees are drawn from
the same (or closely-related) disciplines, everyone in the room will
know in advance that they will be with at least a few people they trust,
which increases the chances of them actually coming. Furthermore, if
people attend a workshop with their labmates, it’s more likely they will
work together to implement what they’ve learned after the workshop has
ended.</p>

<p>We can monitor our own use of stereotypes, but the experiences that
people have before and after our workshop are beyond our control.
Because these experiences are unequal, including historical and
present-day differences in access to resources, mentorship, and other
avenues towards career success, we aim to make Carpentries programs
<em>equitable</em>. This means that, rather than offering the same
access and experience to all, we aim to use our programs to actively
counter-balance unequal opportunities that have led to disproportionate
representation of certain groups in data-centric careers.</p>
<p>If you host a workshop, we encourage you to consider means of
reaching out to historically under-represented groups in your community

<p>One central way that The Carpentries fosters an inclusive, respectful
learning environment is our <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html" class="external-link">Code
of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>All participants in our workshops, activities and communities are
required to abide by the <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html" class="external-link">Code
of Conduct</a>. This code helps to ensure that our community does not
tolerate the persistence of behaviors that harm or exclude others. While
such a code cannot prevent all incidents, reminding participants of the
Code of Conduct supports them in being mindful of the impact of their
words and actions. It also offers reassurance to all that the
instructional team cares about their experience, creating an environment
that is explicitly inclusive and supports safe focus on learning.</p>
<p>We will discuss the Code of Conduct in greater detail in Part 4 of
this training during our discussion of Working with your team.</p>

<h3 id="listening-with-assessment-and-feedback">Listening with Assessment and Feedback<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#listening-with-assessment-and-feedback"></a>
</h3>
<p>Motivating practices like those discussed in the previous episode to
invite participation and encourage a growth mindset can also contribute
to making a classroom more inclusive for diverse learners. However, we
cannot assume that any instructional approach has succeeded at fostering
inclusion if we do not listen to our audience. Explicitly seeking to
learn from and attend to the concerns of your learners is key. If you
find yourself feeling uncertain about whether you are successfully
including all learners, this is a good time to pause and create an
opportunity to listen.</p>
<p>When you are actively providing avenues for feedback, there are two
signs of trouble to watch out for: negative feedback, and a <strong>lack
of feedback</strong>. If an environment does not feel inclusive, many
learners will not feel comfortable reporting this; indeed, they may not
recognize it themselves. It can be difficult to notice the people you
are <em>not</em> hearing from in a room! When in doubt, communicate with
your team and work together to identify and (gently) check in with
anyone you haven’t heard from. In addition, examine your feedback
processes to be sure you are including opportunities for
<strong>anonymous feedback</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="examining-your-actions">Examining your Actions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#examining-your-actions"></a>
</h3>
<p>When you pay close attention to your own actions, this can help you
to do more than (painfully) identify how often you use the word “just”!
Monitoring your actions can also provide you with useful information
about the ways in which you behave differently with different people.
This is normal! It is also an excellent way to identify patterns that
may intefere with your intent to create an inclusive environment for
all. Did you answer the same question in different ways at different
points? If so, why? Who did you feel comfortable chatting with at break
time, and who seemed harder to connect with? Did you offer help to
anyone who didn’t ask for it? Who were you most eager to impress?</p>
<p>Asking yourself questions like these is hard! Answering them is
harder. When you notice things that trouble you, keep a positive and
simple goal in mind: to learn and to improve.</p>

<p>Review your lesson and your notes. Try to make sure you have
everything prepared, so you can get up and go tomorrow. Are you nervous?
If so, how do you usually calm yourself down? Deep breathing,
meditation, going for a walk? Do that. You’re going to do amazing. Get

<p>Please, please, please, wear clothes that you feel comfortable in. I
cannot stress this enough! If you’re not physically comfortable, it will
be so difficult to focus. Consider whether the classroom might be hotter
or colder than you expect– can you wear layers or bring a shawl?</p>
<p>Ideally, you should know your clothing well enough to know how it
moves. Wardrobe malfunctions are real, and you should try to avoid them!
Are you showing something you don’t intend to when you sit down, stand
up, or lean over? Is the material sheer when a projector light shines on
it?</p>
<p>Choose clothes that are culturally appropriate for the setting you’re
teaching in.</p>

<h3 id="your-mindset">Your Mindset<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#your-mindset"></a>

<p>Ideally, you should be able to walk into your training feeling both
calm and confident. If confidence is too much, trying to cultivate a
feeling of calm is a good start. What’s the worst that can happen? Maybe
you look foolish, maybe you waste someone’s time. Who cares? Judgmental
people will always judge you, and kind people will give you grace. These
experiences will help you learn and grow.</p>
<p>You have prepared as much as you can for this. Now it’s time to just
go.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be loud, but people need to hear you. Find a way of
amplifying your voice that works for you. Having a microphone can be a
wonderful accessibility tool if you’re in a room large enough to allow

<p>As you continue teaching, experiment with different ways of speaking
or modulating your town of voice. See which ones keep people most

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="how-do-you-hold-attention">How do You Hold Attention?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-do-you-hold-attention"></a>
</h3>
<p>When you’re teaching, you are, by definition, the center of attention
for the room. You are a figure of authority, and eyes are on you. How do
you keep people focused? This is one of those tricky topics that is much
easier to learn than describe. But here are a few things to keep in
mind.</p>
<p>Having interesting and engaging content helps hold attention, as we
discussed in the content creation section. But you also need to
establish a respectful dynamic from early on.</p>
<p>I suggest establishing three interconnected habits: 1. Show the
participants what good behavior looks like. 2. Reward that good
behavior. 3. Correct bad behavior.</p>
<p>Notice that this doesn’t say “punish people disproportionately
anytime they do something even a little bit out of line”, nor does it
say “pretend bad behavior doesn’t exist and it will go away”. You also
need to make sure that the behavior you want it reasonable. You can’t
expect someone to never look down at their phone in class, but you can
expect them not to play video games on their phone with the volume up
while you’re trying to teach.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="taking-up-space">Taking up Space<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#taking-up-space"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being the center of attention can be anxiety-inducing for people who
prefer to stay on the sidelines. What do you need to believe in order to
bring your most confident self to the lesson?</p>
<p>Ideally, you are able to drive not only the content of the course,
but also the tone of the course. You can act as the emotional steering
wheel of the lesson. Bringing a comfortable, confident sense of self to
your courses can help put everyone else at ease. If you do start to get
nervous or stressed, it can help ease the tension if you just admit that
and ask for a moment of grace.</p>
<p>It can also help people feel engaged if you move physically around
the room, maintain good eye contact, and include everyone in your
attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="giving-attention-to-others">Giving Attention to Others<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#giving-attention-to-others"></a>
</h3>
<p>Again, remember: you’re the steering wheel. People are mimicking you.
So if you give your full attention (eye contact, standing still, being
quiet) when someone is speaking, it will encourage the other
participants to do the same.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="respecting-space">Respecting Space<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#respecting-space"></a>
</h3>
<p>It’s your job to encourage participation, but it’s not your job to
force it. If someone really seems uncomfortable talking in front of the
whole class, don’t force them to. Be aware that some people might not
want you to stand close to them, or touch their laptops. Avoid touching
participants unless it’s necessary for instruction. Even then, ask
permission first. Respect the answer.</p>

<p>One of the cornerstones of The Carpentries teaching is live coding:
<em>instructors do not use slides to teach coding</em>, but work through
the lesson material, typing in the code or instructions, with the
workshop participants following along. This section explains how it
works, why we use it, and gives general tips for an effective
participatory live coding presentation. We will finish this section by
practicing ourselves and providing feedback for each other.</p>
<section id="why-participatory-live-coding"><h2 class="section-heading">Why Participatory Live Coding?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-participatory-live-coding"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We do not use slides in our lessons. Instead, instructors plug their
laptop into the projector and work through the lesson, typing in the
code, reformatting data, and talking as we go. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_coding" class="external-link">“live coding”</a>.
However, the instructor is not live coding in a vacuum. Importantly,
learners are strongly encouraged to “code-along” with the instructor. We
refer to the practice of having the instructor live code and the
learners code along as “participatory live coding” or, less formally,
‘code-along sessions’.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>List some advantages and challenges of participatory live coding from
both a learner’s and an instructor’s point of view.</p>
<p>This discussion should take about 5 minutes.</p>

<div id="collapseSolution1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingSolution1" data-bs-parent="#accordionSolution1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Some advantages are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watching a program being written is more compelling than watching
someone page through slides that present bits and pieces of the same
code.</li>
<li>It enables instructors to be more responsive to “what if?”
questions. Where a slide deck is like a railway track, participatory
live coding allows instructors to go off-road and follow their learners’
interests.</li>
<li>Lateral knowledge transfer: participatory live coding facilitates
the transfer of <a href="https://jonudell.net/udell/2006-09-19-screencasting-of-tacit-knowledge.html" class="external-link">tacit
knowledge</a> – people learn more than we realized we were teaching by
watching <em>how</em> instructors do things.</li>
<li>It slows the instructor down: if she has to type in the program as
she goes along, she can only go twice as fast as her learners, rather
than ten-fold faster as she could with slides.</li>
<li>Learners get to see instructors’ mistakes <em>and how to diagnose
and correct them</em>. Novices are going to spend most of their time
doing this, but it is left out of most textbooks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some challenges are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires instructors to be able to improvise when things go wrong
or when learners have questions not directly addressed in the text of
the lesson.</li>
<li>It can be hard for learners to listen and type at the same time, due
to the<br><em>split-attention effect</em> we <a href="05-memory.html#why-guided-practice-is-important">discussed
earlier</a>. This is why it is very important that instructors first
explain what they are going to do, then say what they are typing as they
type it, and then explain what they did again afterwards.</li>
<li>It may take a bit of practice for instructors to get used to
thinking aloud while coding in front of an audience.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Live coding fits well into the practice-feedback model we have been
discussing - by providing learners with continuous opportunities for
practice (every time they type in a line of code) and continuous
feedback (their code either works or fails with an error message). It is
important to keep in mind, however, that feedback is not helpful if you
cannot understand it. Many error messages are obscure and not written
with novices in mind. Use the strategies for <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation.html" class="external-link">error
framing</a> to make sure this feedback is useful to learners.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Debugging as a skill</strong> – while learners may have
negative associations with “mistakes” or “typos”, it may be useful to
re-frame troubleshooting as the routine process of finding and fixing
“bugs”.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning to parse error messages is an important step in
developing debugging skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Intentional vs accidental errors</strong> - It can be
useful to intentionally demonstrate common mistakes and error messages.
Alternatively, mistakes made by the Instructor or learners can offer
useful opportunities to learn about and positively frame
errors.</p></li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Stand up and move around the room if possible.</strong> This
makes the experience more interactive and less monotonous. Use a
microphone if one is available to make it easier for people with hearing
difficulties to hear you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Go slowly.</strong> For every command you type, every word
of code you write, every menu item or website button you click, say out
loud what you are doing while you do it. Then point to the command and
its output on the screen and go through it a second time. This slows you
down and allows learners to copy what you do, or to catch up. Do not
copy-paste code.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mirror your learners’ environment.</strong> Try to create an
environment that is as similar as possible to what your learners have to
reduce cognitive load. Avoid using keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use your screen wisely.</strong> Use a big font, and
maximize the window. A black font on a white background works better
than a light font on a dark background. When the bottom of the projector
screen is at the same height, or below, the heads of the learners,
people in the back will not be able to see the lower parts. Draw up the
bottom of your window(s) to compensate. Pay attention to the lighting
(not too dark, no lights directly on/above the presenter’s screen) and
if needed, re-position the tables so all learners can see the screen,
and helpers can easily reach all learners.</li>
<li>
<strong>Use illustrations</strong> to help learners understand and
organize the material. You can also generate the illustrations on the
board as you progress through the material. This allows you to build up
diagrams, making them increasingly complex in parallel with the material
you are teaching. It helps learners understand the material, makes for a
more lively workshop and gathers the learners’ attention to you as
well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Turn off notifications</strong> on your laptop and
phone.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stick to the lesson material.</strong> The core Carpentries
lessons are developed collaboratively by many instructors and tried and
tested at many workshops. This means they are very streamlined - which
is great when you start teaching them for the first time. It may be
tempting to deviate from the material because you would like to show a
neat trick, or demonstrate some alternative way of doing something. Do
not do this, since there is a fair chance you will run into something
unexpected that you then have to explain. If you really want to use
something outside of the material, try it out thoroughly before the
workshop: run through the lesson as you would during the actual teaching
and test the effect of your modification. Some instructors use printouts
of the lesson material during teaching. Others use a second device
(tablet or laptop) when teaching, on which they can view their notes and
the Etherpad session. This seems to be more reliable than displaying one
virtual desktop while flipping back and forth to another.</li>
<li>
<strong>Leave no learner behind.</strong> You will learn later in
the training <a href="21-management.html#sticky-notes">how sticky notes
can be used to gauge learners’ progress and understanding</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Embrace mistakes.</strong> No matter how well prepared you
are, you will make mistakes. This is OK! Use these opportunities to do
<a href="08-motivation.html">error framing</a> and to help your learners
learn the art of troubleshooting.</li>
<li>
<strong>Have fun!</strong> It is OK to use humor and improvisation
to liven up the workshop. This becomes easier when you are more familiar
with the material, and more relaxed. Start small, even just saying ‘that
was fun’ after something worked well is a good start.</li>

<li>After each person finishes, each group member should share feedback
(starting with themselves) using the same 2x2 rubric we used for the
YouTube videos. The timekeeper should keep feedback discussion to about

<p>At the beginning of this course, you got into groups and worked
together to design and teach a short lesson. On Thursday and Friday of
this week, each group presented their lesson. You had 30 minutes total
to introduce your topic, teach it with live coding, and deliver a brief
assessment. Afterwards, we had 10 minutes of feedback before moving on
to the next group. We gave feedback on both the course itself and the

<p>Ok, now we can zoom out from the assessment to think about the
curriculum overall. Let’s talk through the internal-reflection notes you
wrote earlier, and discuss some common themes.</p>

decide how you want to update the lesson as a whole.</div>
</figure><p>You also got some feedback from your peers right after the lesson.
We’re going to collect all those notes and distribute them to you in the
coming days.</p>
<p>What feedback did you find most helpful about your
<strong>content</strong>? What feedback did you find most helpful about
your <strong>delivery</strong>?</p>
<p>What are you most proud of? What’s the first thing you want to change
next time?</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to sit with all the feedback you’ve received and
categorize it:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What are things you want to modify <strong>with high
priority</strong>?</li>
<li>What are things you want to modify <strong>with low
priority</strong>?</li>
<li>What feedback will you <strong>respectfully leave
behind</strong>?</li>
</ol></section><section id="surveys"><h2 class="section-heading">Surveys<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#surveys"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Even if you never ask your course participants for feedback, you can
still evaluate your curriculum based on your own experience of the
lesson using some of the questions we listed above. We strongly
recommend asking your participants for feedback, but you can do so a few
different ways.</p>
<p>For the purpose of these short lessons, we asked participants to give
live feedback. They were probably pretty forthright about it because
these people are your peers. But in a real classroom setting, people
might feel uncomfortable giving constructive feedback straight to your
face. This is where <strong>anonymized surveys</strong> come in
handy.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-pre-survey">The Pre-Survey<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-pre-survey"></a>
</h3>
<p>Pre-surveys are less common than post-surveys, but we find them to be
very useful for assessing the impact of the course.</p>
<p>For this training, all of you began by taking a pre-course survey
that helped me understand what interest and experience level you were
starting from. This allowed me to design content at a pace and level
that I thought might be most appropriate. I also asked you to
self-evaluate your own skills at different teaching tasks. In the
post-survey, I will ask you to self-evaluate those same questions to see
if your perception of your skill has changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-post-survey">The Post-Survey<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-post-survey"></a>
</h3>
<p>Post-course surveys allows participants a safe and anonymous space to
provide feedback. If you conducted a pre-survey that included
self-evaluations of skills, include those same questions again to assess
how those self-evaluations have changed. Post-surveys will additionally
include questions about the course content itself, what went well or
poorly, and how we could improve in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Creating an anonymous post-survey is a great way of showing
your course participants that you’re committed to improving. Filling out
the post-survey is a wonderful way of respecting your instructor, and
helping them on their growth journey. The less you enjoyed the course,
the more helpful your feedback might be.</strong></p>
<p>If you are looking for inspiration on how to design surveys, the
Carpentries makes <a href="https://carpentries.org/assessment/" class="external-link">their
survey questions publicly available</a>. We modified the Instructor
Training surveys for this course, but the standard pre-and post-workshop
surveys are more appropriate if you’re teaching a technical topic.</p>

<p>It has been a busy couple of weeks! Over the last nine days of course
work, we’ve learned and practiced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growth mindsets and the ASK framework for feedback;</li>
<li>Skill levels, mental models, and identifying misconceptions;</li>
<li>The principles of backwards design for lesson planning;</li>
<li>Identifying a target audience and course prerequisites;</li>
<li>Writing course objectives and crafting an advertisement for
lessons;</li>
<li>Designing formative assessments;</li>
<li>Lesson planning and choosing an appropriate format to deliver lesson
content;</li>
<li>Accessibility, inclusion, and equity in the classroom;</li>
<li>How to interact with the physical space you inhabit as an
instructor;</li>
<li>Principles of live coding;</li>
<li>How to evaluate and refine curricula.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re so grateful for your time and attention over the course of
these two weeks. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we
encountered difficulties with the technology and the space. We hope you
enjoyed this course, and we’re so excited to see what you achieve moving
forward.</p>
<p>You can email us anytime: Amelia is <a href="mailto:amelia.bertozzi-villa@gatesfoundation.org" class="email">amelia.bertozzi-villa@gatesfoundation.org</a>, and Punam
is <a href="mailto:pamratia@ihi.or.tz" class="email">pamratia@ihi.or.tz</a>.</p>
<p>We’re going to ask you to fill out an exit survey before you leave,
but with the time we have remaining: is there any feedback you would
like to offer us in person? We’re happy for it to be positive or
constructive, general or specific– just remember to use the ASK
framework.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
