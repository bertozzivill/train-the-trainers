It has been a busy couple of weeks! Over the last nine days of course
work, we've learned and practiced:

-   Growth mindsets and the ASK framework for feedback;
-   Skill levels, mental models, and identifying misconceptions;
-   The principles of backwards design for lesson planning;
-   Identifying a target audience and course prerequisites;
-   Writing course objectives and crafting an advertisement for lessons;
-   Designing formative assessments;
-   Lesson planning and choosing an appropriate format to deliver lesson
    content;
-   Accessibility, inclusion, and equity in the classroom;
-   How to interact with the physical space you inhabit as an
    instructor;
-   Principles of live coding;
-   How to evaluate and refine curricula.

We're so grateful for your time and attention over the course of these
two weeks. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we
encountered difficulties with the technology and the space. We hope you
enjoyed this course, and we're so excited to see what you achieve moving
forward.

We're going to ask you to fill out an exit survey before you leave, but with the time we have remaining: is there any feedback you would like to offer us in person? We're happy for it to be positive or constructive, general or specific-- just remember to use the ASK framework.

Thank you so much!
