## Feedback Collection Plan

There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching, hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you should be doing:

- __constantly and throughout the workshop__
  - As notes taken by an observer/co-instructor - refer to the ["Pilot Workshops" episode](operations.md#pilot-workshops) for suggestions on things to track and the [pilot workshop notes template][pilot-notes-template] and other suggested feedback collection mechanisms to help you gather such information.
  - As "minute card" feedback from learners - minute cards are short comments from learners on what is working well and what could be improved, provided frequently (e.g. at the end of each session). Like exercises used as formative assessment, minute card feedback can be provided by learners while there is still time for instructors to act on it and adjust their approach. You may find [the Virtual Minute Card template][minute-card-template] helpful for workshops run online, and [the Instructor Training curriculum describes how sticky notes can be used at in-person events][it-minute-cards].
- __at a designated wrap-up and feedback session at the end of the workshop.__ Here, you can cover any other feedback that was not addressed up to that point and any specific questions you may want to ask your audience (e.g. about the choice of topics for the lesson, difficulty level, workshop operations). You may design a special form that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a [post-workshop survey template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview) for workshops that pilot a lesson in The Carpentries Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you can supplement it with additional questions.

## Exercise: homework

The final part of this training will focus on the skills needed to collaborate
effectively. Before that there will be a break,
during which we would like you to complete the following three tasks:

1. Teach one episode of your lesson (probably the one you have been working on in these two days).
   See the [Lesson Trial Runs](../learners/trial-runs.md) page for full details.
2. After your trial run has concluded
   (immediately after, or when you have reviewed any feedback you collected from learners),
   note down your answers to the following questions:
   - What worked?
   - What did not?
   - What will you do differently next time?
   - What will you change in your material you taught?
     We will refer to these notes when we reconvene for the last episode of this training.
3. Based on your experience teaching the material and the feedback you received from your learners and helpers,
   make a list of issues you have identified with the material you prepared, e.g.:
   - examples that did not work as expected,
   - improvements that could be made to exercises,
   - parts that learners found particularly challenging,
   - unexpected questions or misconceptions that came up during the trial run.

    We will return to these notes during the final training session,
    so please make sure you save them somewhere you will be able to find them again easily when the time comes.

## What questions do you have? (15 minutes)

The homework from this workshop includes a trial run of one of the episodes
you have been developing in your lesson, to a real audience.

After reading [the information provided about the trial run task](../learners/trial-runs.md) and thinking about this task,
what questions do you have about how you should
approach teaching that trial run?
Is there anything you are unsure of?
What resources might help you prepare for that experience?

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- Spending time on preparing your teaching and feedback collection will make you and your participants get the most out of your workshop pilot.
- Creating clear setup instructions as part of your lesson and circulating them ahead of the pilot is time well-invested and will give you more time when teaching the lesson.
- Instructor Notes are teaching tips that you should include with your lesson to help you (a few months down the line) and other instructors, who have the relevant topic knowledge but have not been involved in the lesson design and development, deliver your lesson more successfully.
