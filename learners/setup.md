## Software Setup

### R and RStudio

If you have not already done so, please follow the [R setup instructions](https://bertozzivill.github.io/r-install-instructions) to download or update your R and RStudio. 


### Reticulate for RStudio

We will also need to download a few packages so that we can run Python from RStudio. To make this possible, install the `reticulate` package into your RStudio.

## Data Sets

```{=html}
<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
-->
```
Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to
your Desktop.
